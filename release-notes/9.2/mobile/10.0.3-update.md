**Action** buttons have also been added for faster access to the most used functionality.

## Mobile CRM – improved user experience for action buttons (10.0.3)

When you click on any **Action** button that takes you to another application, (for example Maps, email) or starts a call or SMS, you will now go through an additional step.

Before the action is carried out you will be able to see the address, email, phone number, and such that the **Action** button will use. You can then decide whether to continue with the action.
