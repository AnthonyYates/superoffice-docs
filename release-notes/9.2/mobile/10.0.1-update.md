# SuperOffice Mobile CRM - 10.0.1 update

## SuperOffice has launched a new CRM app

We have released a new mobile CRM app: **SuperOffice Mobile CRM**. You can recognize the new Mobile CRM app from the green SuperOffice logo.

To be able to use the new app you need to use:

* SuperOffice CRM version 9.1 or newer
* Android OS: version 5.0 or newer
* iOS: version 10.0 or newer (iPhone 5S or newer)

You can download **SuperOffice Mobile CRM** from the App Store or Google Play.

Our previous CRM app, Pocket CRM, will still be available and show data from your SuperOffice database when you use SuperOffice 9. However, we will not develop new features for Pocket CRM.
