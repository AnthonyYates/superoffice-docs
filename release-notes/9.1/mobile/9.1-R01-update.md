Users who use SuperOffice version 8.5 or lower can continue to use Pocket CRM as they are used to.

All users of SuperOffice 9 are advised to download and use the new mobile CRM app instead.

The new app has the new look and feel as the SuperOffice CRM version 9. It is also significantly faster to use.

All new feature will be added to the Mobile CRM application under the G9 roadmap.

If you use SuperOffice 9, you can continue to use Pocket CRM, however we will not develop any new features for the Pocket CRM app.

SuperOffice Mobile CRM is available to download via Apple App Store, Google Play and SuperOffice App Store. To migrate to the new app, download the new (green owl) and delete Pocket CRM (red owl) from your device.
