# Manage permissions

Depending on their role, users need different permissions. For basic access: Login + Read. To make changes, they need access to one or more of the following areas:

* Manage contents of App Store pages (App Store)
* Configure apps (Configuration)
* User management (Users)

1. In the Developer Portal, go to your partner page.
2. Select **Users** from the left menu.
3. Locate the user in the list and click **Edit item**.
4. To grant a permission, tic the corresponding checkbox. To remove a permission, remove the tic.
