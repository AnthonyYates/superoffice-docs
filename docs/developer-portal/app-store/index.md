# App Store information

[!include[ALT](../../includes/def-app-store.md)]

As a partner that offers one or more applications through the [SuperOffice App Store][1], you need to create and maintain two sets of public information:

* Your company profile page
* One or more app-specific product pages

## What would you like to do?

* [Update the public company profile][2]
* [Update the product page of an application][3]
* List a new application in the App Store
* Publish a new version of an existing application
* Add or update images and videos
* [Improve SEO][4]
