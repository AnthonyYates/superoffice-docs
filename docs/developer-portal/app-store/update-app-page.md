# Update app-specific page

<!-- Previous: https://community.superoffice.com/new-application-listing-->

The information shown on your app-specific product pages in the App Store comes from:

* Application settings
* App Store information

## Verify your changes

1. Review your listing in the SOD App Store.
2. Fix issues in the Developer Portal if necessary.

## Request to publish

> [!NOTE]
> The App Store information is only the commercial side of releasing an application.
>
> When you list an application for the first time, you must also prepare and request to publish the configuration.

When you are happy with how it looks, return to your partner page in the Developer Portal:

1. Select **Overview** from the left menu.
2. In the **App Store** section, click the **Request to Publish** button.
