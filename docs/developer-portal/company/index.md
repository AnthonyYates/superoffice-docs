# Partner

As a partner that offers one or more applications through the [SuperOffice App Store][1], you need to create and maintain two sets of public information:

* Your company profile page
* One or more app-specific product pages

## What would you like to do?

* [Add or update partner settings][2]
* [Change contact persons][3]
* Manage permissions within the organization
* Add a user
* [Register new app][4]
