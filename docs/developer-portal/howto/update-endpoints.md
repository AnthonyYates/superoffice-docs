# Update endpoints

Which SuperOffice endpoints you get access to by default depend on the template you selected when registering the application. [See list of default configuration.][1] We highly recommend that all new apps use our **WebAPI**.

and which endpoints you need to host d and its intended functionality.

## What can I change?

## Application - Configuration

1. In the Developer Portal, go to your application page.
2. Select **Configuration** from the left menu.
3. Click the **Request to Publish** button.
4. The version is now listed as pending. Look for the support email from us.

* [CORS and redirection URLs][6]
* [Notifications][7]
* Mirroring, ERP sync, or quote endpoints
* For any other values, contact the App Manager via our chat.
