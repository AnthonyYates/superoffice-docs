Add a group to the StatLib instance. A group is a subset of the results which has a common value for a given column. Aggregate values can be calculated for groups (i.e. avergage response time pr. category).



* **column:** The column to use as the group identifier (i.e. the field which will identify the groups).
* **desc:** If True, then we'll sort this group descending, otherwise ascending.
