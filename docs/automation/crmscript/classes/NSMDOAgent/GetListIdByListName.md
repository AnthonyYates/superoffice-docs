Retrieve the UdListDefinition id of a list, by its name. Not all lists have such an ID, but those that are based on tables do (the list name is then the same as the table name)



* **name:** The list name, same as the table name for lists that are backed by tables
* **Returns:** List id in the UdListDefinition table
