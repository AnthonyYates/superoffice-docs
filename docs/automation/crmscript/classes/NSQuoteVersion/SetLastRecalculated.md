When this version was last subjected to a total recalculation. This field must be set by the connector, since the connector may choose to ignore a RecalculateVersion call based on policies and possibly the current value of this field. SuperOffice will set this field to 1.1.1760 whenever any change occurs to the quote, to indicate that a recalculation is needed.



* **LastRecalculated:** DateTime
* **Returns:** DateTime
