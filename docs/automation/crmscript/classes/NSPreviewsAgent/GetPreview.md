Parse a Preview hint and return a Preview. The returned Preview string may contain resource string identifiers (in square brackets), to be processed by the resource manager.\<para />The Preview hint is either a literal text, representing itself, or a set of key/value pairs enclosed in curly braces. Each key is separated from its value by an equals sign, and each pair from the next by an ampersand, according to usual conventions.\<para />A typical Preview hint could be {contact\_id=123} or {appointment\_id=222&mode=simple}
