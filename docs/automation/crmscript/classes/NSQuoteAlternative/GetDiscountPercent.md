The discount the sales rep specifies, in percent. Both the two ‘DiscountPercent’ and ‘DiscountAmount’ shall be filled out, but the UserValueOverride field must be set to the field the user actually changed. If this field is filled out by the user, it overrides the discount suggested by the connector. If the user has not filled any values, the system will copy the ERP discount percent value into this field. The Percentage is given in integer form, i.e. ‘12%’ is represented as ‘12’.



* **Returns:** Float
