A re-open appointment should be created as a reminder to re-open the sale at a certain date with information regarding the stalled sale.



* **saleId:** The identifier of the stalled sale from which we create a re-open appointment
* **Returns:** The re-open appointment with start date = the re-open date of the sale and a description matching the sales stalled reason.
