To use CRMScripts in your SuperOffice environment, you need a subscription to Expander Services.

## Creating CRMScripts

### Which editors can I use?

You can use whatever code editor you prefer. For example, Visual Studio Code. You can even use Notepad.

However, we recommend using the built-in editor in the SuperOffice admin client. This will give you coding assistance and **syntax highlighting**. You also have easy access to run and debug the script as you develop it.

## Running CRMScripts

> [!WARN]
> CRMScript is extremely powerful. Unless you are cautious, scripting could potentially damage the data in your system. Know what you are doing and always test in a closed environment first.

**Pre-requisites:**

* An administrator account for the tenant or installation
* An Expander Services license

### Where does CRMScript run?

You need to run your scripts in an environment that has a CRMScript **interpreter**.
For SuperOffice CRM Online, this is available in the Sales and Service admin clients.

**In Sales:**

1. Open the Admin client by selecting **Settings and maintenance** from the hamburger menu.
2. Select **CRMScript** from the left menu.

**In Service:**

1. Click the cogwheel in the upper-right corner.
2. Click **System design** and then click **CRMScript**.

### How to add a script

> [!TIP]
> Create a new folder to group your scripts.

1. Click **New script**.
2. At the **Information** tab, name your script, add a description.
3. Enter a label to uniquely identify it when included in other scripts.
4. Select the **Script** tab. Then type or paste your script.
5. Click **OK** to save and **Execute script** to run it.

> [!TIP]
> If you don't see the **New script** button, you probably lack a valid license for Expander Services.

### How do I get a sandbox?

You need to [!include[register as a developer](./includes/link-register-dev.md)] as a developer to get access to our online development environment.

This signs you up for a developer user account and creates a test tenant in the SuperOffice Online Development (SOD) environment.

## Expander Services

Expander Services is our name for a set of tools that allow you to customize your CRM solution and to integrate other applications with SuperOffice. These tools extend beyond the standard configuration options offered to you out-of-the-box in the **Settings and maintenance** module.

Expander Services is a **subscription-based** license available to all customers. It doesnâ€™t matter if you run SuperOffice CRM in the cloud or have it installed on your premises.

When you subscribe to Expander Services, you get access to the following tools:

* CRMScript
* Extra tables: Add new tables to the database and increase your flexibility
* Custom screens: Create new screens in Service to support your specific processes
* SuperOffice APIs: Create customizations by using developers' tools
