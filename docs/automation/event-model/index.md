# CRMScript event model

The event model was introduced in version 4.2. The scripts are connected to events by setting the include-id of the script to values recognized by the system.

Currently, only event scripts for pages are supported, which are in the `HtmlPage.` namespace. In the future, other events, such as database saving or loading may be supported by using other namespace areas.
