## How do user plans affect my app?

A customer can choose 1 of the following billing periods for their CRM solution:

* once a month
* very 3 months
* every 6 months
* annually

The contract period is for 12 months. After the first 12 months, they are automatically renewed for another billing period, according to their choice.

Customers can combine plans that best fit their needs. They can also add or change user plans later on.

You should keep this flexibility in mind when integrating with specific features and deciding your pricing model.
