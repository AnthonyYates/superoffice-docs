# Diary

Appointments are the foundation of the SuperOffice diary.

## Appointment owner

`Associate` acts as the owner of the appointment. If you don't assign an associate to the `Associate` property of the appointment, the current user will become the owner of the appointment and only one row will be added to the `appointment` table when the appointment is saved.
