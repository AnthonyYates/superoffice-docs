# Authenticate and authorize Google

This is step 5 in [connecting your provider][1]. It is provider-specific.

1. You will be forwarded to the providers' authentication portal to authenticate and validate your user and to confirm you allow to connect it to SuperOffice.

If it says "Logged in as xxx and connected to Google" under **Configure settings**, you may close this browser window - to go back to SuperOffice "Settings and maintenance" to confirm the setup.
