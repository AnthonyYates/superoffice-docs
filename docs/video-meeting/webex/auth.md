# Authenticate and authorize Webex Meetings

This is step 5 in [connecting your provider][1]. It is provider-specific.

1. Add the SuperOffice app from the Cisco app store, by supplying our Integration ID when asked:

    ```

    The SuperOffice app for Cisco Webex integration ID will be added to your Cisco Webex admin page at [https://admin.webex.com][2]:

2. You will be forwarded to the providers' authentication portal to authenticate and validate your user and to confirm you allow to connect it to SuperOffice.

3. Webex Meetings has some additional configurations, only a password is required: set your random password and click **Save**.

If it says "Connected to Webex. Logged in as xxx, connected to custxxxx", and password filled under **Set Configurations**, you may close this browser window - to go back to SuperOffice Settings and maintenance to confirm the setup.
