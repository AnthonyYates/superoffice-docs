You will always find a list of template variables when you click for help in the maintenance client or in our [help center][1].

However, when we release new service releases there may be new template variables added that will not be available in the helpfile yet. This page is where it is first updated.

If you encounter a problem with templates check [Document templates troubleshooting][2].
