# Get notifications when tenant status changes

When a tenant installation undergoes changes, SuperOffice sends a change notification to each approved application.

## To receive notifications (onetime set-up)

1. Set up a web service listening for state changes. For example:

```csharp
https://www.awesomeapp.com/NotifyCustomerStateChange
```

2. Notify SuperOffice about yourÂ **State Change URL**, which specifies where SuperOffice sends notifications.

## Parsing notifications

The JSON payload contains the following information:

* tenant context identifier
* the [change type][1]
* a text representation of the installation version
* the version of the file set
* a JWT to verify it was sent by SuperOffice

```javascript
{
  "ChangeType": 0,
  "ContextIdentifier": "Cust12345",
  "VersionName": "Release 8.4 R08",
  "FileVersion": "8.4.12.1234",
  "Token": "ejy234ASD...1234#"
}
```
