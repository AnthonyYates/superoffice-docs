# Getting started

SuperOffice CRM is easy to get started with. It is extremely user-friendly with many new functions to make your working day more productive.

Both new users and previous users of SuperOffice will benefit from reading this user guide. It gives an overview of the facilities and functions in SuperOffice CRM and explains how the program will benefit you and your company.
