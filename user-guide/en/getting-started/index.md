# Getting started

SuperOffice CRM is easy to get started with. It is extremely user-friendly with many new functions to make your working day more productive.

Both new users and previous users of SuperOffice will benefit from reading this user guide. It gives an overview of the facilities and functions in SuperOffice CRM and explains how the program will benefit you and your company.

## Using in-app help

This help has been designed to give you comprehensive and readily accessible information about how to use SuperOffice CRM. Wherever you are in the program, no matter what you are doing, you can always get help about the precise task you are involved in.

You can open the help in three ways:

* Select **Help Index** on the **Help** menu.
* Press **F1**. This opens the help topic for the current screen.
* Click the **Help** button displayed in the individual windows.

## Main sections

SuperOffice CRM consists of the following main sections:

* [Dashboard][7]
* [Company][8]
* [Contact][9]
* [Diary][10]
* [Sale][11]
  * [Quote][12]
* [Project][13]
* [Selection][14]
* [Inbox][15]
* [Chat][16]
* [Reports][17]
* [Marketing][18]

You can easily switch between these screens by clicking the buttons in the [Navigator][1]).

Access to other useful functions is just a click away with the **New** button (in the [Top bar][2]) and the [global buttons][3].

## Differences between onsite and online installations

SuperOffice is available as an online application (cloud-based) and as an onsite application (installed on the customer's premises). There are a number of minor differences between the two. Specific functional differences are indicated by the icons in the procedures themselves or in topic titles.
