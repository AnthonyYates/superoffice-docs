# Settings and maintenance

Settings and maintenance is the web-based administration client for SuperOffice CRM.

> [!NOTE]
> Settings and maintenance cannot be used for Satellite, only for the central database.

Certain features like replication, Travel, Satellite, import and scripting are only available from the [Windows-based administration client][1].

The buttons in Settings and maintenance activate their associated functions with a single click, making it easy to navigate quickly between the different parts of the program.
