# Using the chat function from the customer's perspective

From the customer's point of view, the chat function works as follows:

1. The customer clicks the chat icon on a web page.

2. The customer enters name, e-mail address and any other required information (unless this is not required).

    > [!NOTE]
    > SuperOffice will check and validate the e-mail address to make sure it is an existing domain name. Basic e-mail address syntax will also be checked.

3. The customer enters a question in the text area and presses **ENTER**. Wait while the system finds an available agent.
    * If the function for FAQ suggestions has been activated for this chat channel, a list of relevant FAQs are displayed.
    * If the suggested FAQs do not answer the customer's question, they can start the chat.

4. The chat is placed in the queue until an agent responds.

5. The customer chats with the agent.

6. When the conversation is finished, the customer can end the chat by closing the chat window. Alternatively, the agent can end the chat by selecting ![icon][img1] &gt; **End chat**.
    * If the post-chat form has been activated for this chat channel, the customer will have the option to return to the chat.
    * If the **Enable transcript** function has been activated for this chat channel, the customer can choose to receive a log of your conversation via e-mail. The e-mail uses a reply template in SuperOffice Service.

## Incoming chats when no agents are present (outside working hours)

If no agents are available (typically outside working hours), a short message is displayed in the chat window. Example: "Sorry. We are closed. Our opening hours are ..."

If request submission has been activated for this chat channel, the customers can enter their name, e-mail address, and a question. The request ID is displayed in the chat window.
