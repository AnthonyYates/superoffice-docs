# Chat

The **Chat** feature in SuperOffice allows your support agents and sales people to chat with customers, potential customers and other people via the chat widget/window on your web site. This feature can for instance be used for service/support and pre-sales, and it easily integrates with [FAQ][1], [documents/attachments][2] and [templates][3]. The chat feature can be set up with multiple chat channels for different topics, such as technical support, product questions and sales support.

Your agents can access chat via the Navigator in both SuperOffice CRM and SuperOffice Service.

The **Chat** screen consists of the following tabs:

* **Dashboard**: This tab displays statistics for all or selected chat channels. Incoming chats and ongoing chat sessions are listed here.
* **Chats**: This is where the agent chats with customers.

## The Dashboard tab

In the **Dashboard** tab you can view chat statistics, respond to incoming chats, and listen to ongoing chats (if you have this permission). The number in the **Dashboard** tab indicates how many incoming chats have not been answered by an agent.

## The Chats tab

Use the **Chats** tab to respond to incoming chats from customers.

![The Chats tab -screenshot][img5] The number in the **Chats** tab indicates the number of chats you are currently handling.

The **Chats** tab has three main areas:

* List of active/recent chat sessions (left side)
* Chat conversation (middle)
* Contact side panel (right side) â†’ showing customer information

### List of active/recent chat sessions

This list contains

* ongoing chats
* recently completed chats (last 8 hours)

The number of chats in queue is also listed here, and you can click **Get next in queue** to respond to the next chat in the queue.

The following icons are used for the active chat sessions in the list:

| Icon | Description |
|---|---|
| ![icon][img2] | The last message in the conversation from the customer and agent. |
| ![icon][img3] | Number of unread messages from the customer. |
| ![icon][img4] | Transferred chat to you or from you. Waiting to be accepted. |

### Chat conversation

Here you can [chat with the customer][4].

The following actions are available in the chat conversation:

* [Create request in chat][11]
* [Transfer a chat to another agent][12]
* [Send FAQs, reply templates and quick replies in a chat][13]
* [Send files in chat][14]
* [Create a quick reply][15]

### Contact side panel (right side)

When a customer contacts you in the chat and is already registered in SuperOffice, you can display relevant information about them in the side panel on the right side of the **Chat** screen. You can also add new customers as new contacts (and new companies).

Here you can match the customer in the chat with an existing contact in SuperOffice, or create a new contact and/or company.

If the customer is found in SuperOffice, you can show contact information, requests, sales, follow-ups and previous chat sessions that have been registered for this contact in SuperOffice.
