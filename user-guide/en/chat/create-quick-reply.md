# Create a quick reply

A quick reply is a pre-defined text that you can use in a chat with a customer. Using quick replies will save you time, since you do not have to type out typical replies like "I will check that and get back to you shortly" or "I need your customer ID to process your request". The quick replies you create will only be available to you.

To create a quick reply:

1. In an ongoing chat, click ![icon][img1] in the lower part of the chat panel.
2. Click ![icon][img2] **Edit**. The **Quick replies** windows opens.
3. Click **Add**. A new reply is added to the list.
4. Click the **New name** field and enter a title for the quick reply. This will not be visible to the customer.
5. Click the **New content** field and enter the reply text you want to send to customers.
6. Click **Save**. The window closes and the new quick reply is saved. You can now [select the quick reply during a chat][1].
