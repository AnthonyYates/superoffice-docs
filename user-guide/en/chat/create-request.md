# Create request in chat

If you cannot solve the issue via the chat, you can create a request to be handled by someone else.

To create a request in an active chat:

1. Click ![icon][img1] and select **Create request**. The **Create request** dialog opens.
2. Fill in the relevant fields.
3. The chat log has been added to the request, but you can add more information here if necessary.
4. Click **Save**.
5. A short message containing the request ID is added to the text field in the chat. Click **Send** to send this to the customer.
