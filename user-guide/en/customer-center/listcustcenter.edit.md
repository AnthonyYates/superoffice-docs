# Customer centre source files

[!include[Requirement](../includes/req-cep.md)]

In the **Customer centre source files** screen, you can edit the default pages in your customer centre.

Do as follows:

1. Select ![icon][img1] **System settings** &gt; **Customer centre source files**.

2. Click a web page in the list.

3. Click a language tab. The html code for the page opens in a simple text editor.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the page is empty, copy the html code from another language tab.

4. Make any necessary changes.

5. Click **Apply** to save your changes without closing the window, or click **OK** to save and exit.

If you later want to revert a page to the original contents, open the page and click **Restore default**.
