When the import is complete, two lists will be displayed:

* New companies/contacts which have been imported.
* Existing companies/contacts which have been changed as a result of the import.

Above each list is a link to the selection with the new/changed companies/contacts.

> [!TIP]
> If you have imported new companies/contacts and there are problems with the imported data, you can open this selection in SuperOffice CRM and delete the new companies/contacts.
