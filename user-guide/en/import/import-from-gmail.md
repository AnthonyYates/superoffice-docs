# Import from Gmail

[!include[Back up database before import](includes/caution-backup-before-import.md)]

To import your Gmail companies into the SuperOffice database:

## Import companies/contacts from Gmail

1. [!include[Open Import](includes/open-import.md)]

2. Click the Gmail icon ( ![icon][img2] ) under **Select an import source**.

    What you need to do in the next step depends on whether you are already logged in to Gmail.

3. One of the following dialogs will be displayed:

    * **Request for permission**: If this dialog appears, you are already logged in to Gmail. Click **Give access**.
    * **Google accounts**: If this dialog appears, you are not logged in to Gmail. Type in the user name and password, and log in to Gmail. Click **Give access**.
        Your Gmail companies will be displayed in Settings and maintenance.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The companies from Gmail will not be imported into the SuperOffice database yet. SuperOffice will only upload the company list from Gmail, so that you can specify the import settings.
