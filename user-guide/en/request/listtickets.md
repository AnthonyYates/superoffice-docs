# Find requests

If you want to find a specific request in SuperOffice Service, do one of the following:

* Use lists, which are actually predefined searches. See [Use lists][1].
* Use the search screen for requests. See [Search for requests][2].
* Use the quick search in the top right corner. See [Use quick search][3].

> [!TIP]
> There is more general information about searching in the [Search in SuperOffice Service][4] topic.
