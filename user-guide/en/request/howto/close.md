# Close requests

Once you have responded to the request, you can set its status to **Closed**. This can be done in two different ways:

* When you send the final [request to a customer][1], you can also select **Closed** under **Status** in the **Properties** tab.
* You can [open a request][2] at any time and select **Closed** in the **Status** list.
* If you [forward the request to an external party][3], who will handle and complete the request, you can select **Close request**.
