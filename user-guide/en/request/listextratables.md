# List tables

[!include[Requirement](../includes/req-expander-services.md)]

The **Tables** screen displays the tables that are configured in the system. Using these tables, you can store data in the system exactly as you wish.

> [!NOTE]
> The data structures are configured in ![icon][img1] **System settings &gt; System design &gt; Tables**, where you can display and edit data content in the tables. Only administrators have access to this screen. See [Tables][1].
