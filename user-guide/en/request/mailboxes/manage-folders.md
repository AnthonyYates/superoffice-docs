# Administrate email address folders

Under **Knowledge Base** > **E-mail addresses** you can create a folder structure for e-mail addresses, to give them a logical structure and make it easy for others to find information. You can create subfolders in all folders, and you can place e-mail addresses in any of these folders as appropriate. Find out more below about how to work with the folder structure.

## Create folders

[!include[How to create a folder](../../includes/howto-create-folder-kb.md)]

You are now ready to [add email addresses to the new folder][1].

## Delete folders

Before you delete an e-mail folder, you need to remove all the addresses in it. You do this in one of the following ways:

* You can [delete the addresses][2].
* You can move an email address to another folder by changing the content of the **Folder** field when you edit an address.
