# Delete priorities

You cannot delete priorities, but you can set the status of a priority to **Deleted**, to make it unavailable to users and customers.

[!include[Go to priority](includes/goto-priority.md)]

1. Click the required priority. The **Priority** tab appears.

1. Click the **Deleted** check box.

1. Click **Save**. The priority will then no longer be available, for example, when users create new requests.

> [!TIP]
> To show deleted/inactive priorities, click the **Show deleted items** check box below the list of priorities.
