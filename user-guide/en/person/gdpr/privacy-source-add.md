# Add items to the Privacy - Source list

[!include[Edit list item](../../includes/edit-list-item.md)] when you are adding an item to the **Privacy - Source** list:

1. Enter the name of the item in the **Name** field.

2. Enter a unique identifier for the source in the **Key** field. This value will remain unique independent of database and is used by developers.

3. **Automatically send confirmation e-mail to contact**: Select this option if you want to send an automatic confirmation to new contacts when this source is used as a legal basis for their consent.

    An email address must be registered on this contact.

4. If you selected the option above, you must select a template for the confirmation to be sent to the contact.

    Only document templates where the option **Privacy e-mail template** has been activated, are available in the list. See [Add a document template][1].

5. Type in a description of the item in the **Description** field.

6. [!include[Save or cancel](../../includes/save-or-cancel.md)]
