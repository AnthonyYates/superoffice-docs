# Delete contacts (Contact screen)

Why would you delete contacts in SuperOffice? A contact may have been added by mistake or be a duplicate, or a contact has been added with only a first name etc.

There are three ways you can delete a contact from SuperOffice CRM:

* Delete a contact from the **Contact** screen.
* Delete a contact from the **Company** screen.
* Bulk delete contacts at once. See [Bulk update][3].

> [!TIP]
> Instead of deleting a contact, you can check **Former employee** in the contact card (see [Create new contact][6]). Then this personâ€™s name will not disappear from activities, for example, to which he or she is linked.

For details about deleting items, see [Delete items in SuperOffice CRM][4].)
