# Delete contacts

Why would you delete contacts in SuperOffice? For example, contact may have been added by mistake or be a duplicate, or a contact has been added with only a first name.

There are three ways you can delete a contact from SuperOffice CRM:

* Delete a contact from the **Contact** screen.
* Delete a contact from the **Company** screen.
* [Bulk delete][3] contacts at once.

> [!TIP]
> Instead of deleting a contact, you can check **Former employee** in the contact card (see [Create new contact][6]). Then this personâ€™s name will not disappear from activities they are linked to.
