# Delete relation (Contact screen)

You can delete relations that have been set up, as follows:

1. [!include[Go to Contact screen](includes/goto-contact.md)]
2. Right-click the required relation on the **Relations** section tab and select **Delete**. The **Delete Relation** dialog opens.
3. Click **Yes** to confirm that you really want to delete the relation. (For more details about this, see [Delete items in SuperOffice CRM][3].)
