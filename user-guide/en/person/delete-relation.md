# Delete relation (Contact screen)

You can delete relations that have been set up, as follows:

[!include[Go to Contact screen](../includes/goto-contact.md)]

1. Right-click the required relation on the **Relations** section tab and select **Delete**. The **Delete Relation** dialog opens.

1. Click **Yes** to confirm that you really want to delete the relation. (For more details about this, see [Delete items in SuperOffice CRM][3].)
