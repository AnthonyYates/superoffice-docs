# Delete contacts

If you delete a contact, it is not completely removed from the system. It is just marked as deleted. Proceed as follows:

1. Open the **Contact** screen.
2. Click the ![icon][img1] **Actions** button and select **Edit contact**. The **Contact properties** screen appears.
3. Click the **Delete** button.
4. Click **OK** when you are asked if you want to delete the contact. The contact is marked as deleted, but any associated requests are not affected by this deletion.

> [!TIP]
> To undo the deletion of a contact, follow the same procedure, but the button then becomes **Activate** instead of **Delete**.
