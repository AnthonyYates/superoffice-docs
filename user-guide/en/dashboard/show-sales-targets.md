# Using sales targets in tiles

If [sales targets][4] are defined for your company, teams/groups and/or sales people, you can add these targets to your dashboard tiles. You will then get a visual presentation of your actual sales and your targets.

## Add tile with sales targets to dashboard

1. Open the **Dashboard** screen.

2. Select the dashboard you want to edit.

3. Click the **Task** button, and select **Add tile / Edit layout**. On the right side of the selected dashboard, the **Add tile / Edit layout** section is displayed.

4. In the **Show tiles for** list, select **Sale**.

5. In the **Library** tab, select one of the following charts:

    * ![icon][img2] - Big number
    * ![icon][img3] - Bar chart
    * ![icon][img4] - Column chart
    * ![icon][img5] - Gauge chart
    * Empty sale tile

    > [!TIP]
    > You can also [select an empty tile][1] to create a tile from scratch, but the chart type must be one of those listed above.

6. To add a tile to the dashboard, drag and drop it on the desired position on the dashboard. You can also click **Add** to add a tile to next available position. The tile will automatically adjust to the available space, and will align with the grid and columns setup.

7. Adjust the tiles on the dashboard:

    * Hold the mouse-pointer over a tile and click and drag the frame to adjust the tile size. Available slots/spaces in the dashboard are highlighted in yellow when the tile can fit in that position.

    * Click the header of a tile and drag it to another position.

8. In the dashboard, click the **Edit tile** icon ![icon][img6] on the new tile.

9. In the **Dataset** tab, set **Sale date** to this year, quarter or month. Edit the other [criteria][2] as necessary. Remember to update the tile name to reflect any changes made here.

10. In the **Layout** tab, edit the layout:

    * **Chart type**: Change this to any chart type listed in step 5.
    * **Measure**: Select **Sum**.
    * **Of**: Select **Amount** or **Weighted amount**.
    * **By**: Select **Sale > Owner** (owner, full name or group) or **Sale > Sale date**.
    * **Period** (only relevant if you selected **Sale date** above): Select year, quarter or month.
    * **Grouping**: Select **Compare to target**. If this option is not visible or is inactive, double-check that you have completed the steps above.

11. Edit the formatting. Based on the chart type you selected, you have additional options under **Formatting**:

    * Big number: You can edit the colours used to display sales targets.
    * Gauge chart: Use the option **Mark target at** to set the sales target on the gauge chart.

12. Click ![icon][img1] to [add a translation][3] to the tile name, titles and labels.

13. Click **Save**. Then click **Done**.
