# View tile data

You can click on data in a tile (for instance a sector in a pie chart) to display the underlying data, open individual records, and copy them to a selection.

[!include[To do this](../includes/to-do-this.md)]

1. Open the **Dashboard** screen.
2. Select the relevant dashboard.
3. Click on data in a tile (for instance a column in a column chart). A new window displays the records in the section you clicked.
4. Here you have the following options:
    * Click a record to see a preview on the right-hand side of the window.
    * Double-click a record to open it (or select a record and click **Open**).
    * To copy the records to a selection, click the **Task** button and select **Copy into selection**. If you do not select any records, all records will be copied. See [Add members to static selections][1].
5. Click **Close** when you are done.
