# Delete a dashboard

To delete a dashboard:

1. Open the **Dashboard** screen.
2. Select the dashboard you want to edit, click the **Task** button, and select **Delete this dashboard**.
3. Click **OK** to confirm. The dashboard is deleted. If you have pinned the dashboard to other users or user groups, they will no longer have access to it.
