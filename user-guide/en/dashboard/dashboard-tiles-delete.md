# Remove a tile

You can remove tiles from a dashboard, as long as you have editing access to it.

> [!NOTE]
> Removed tiles will still be available to add to dashboards. See [Add tiles / Edit layout][1].

To delete a tile:

1. Go to the required dashboard.
2. Click the **Task** button, and select **Add tile / Edit layout**.
3. In the dashboard, click the **Remove tile** icon ( ![icon][img1] ) on the tile you want to remove.
4. Click **OK** to confirm.
