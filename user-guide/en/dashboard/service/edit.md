# Edit a dashboard

To change name and/or layout of the existing dashboard:

1. Open the **Dashboard** screen.
2. Right-click the tab of the required dashboard and select **Edit**. The **Dashboard** dialog opens.
3. Change the name and/or layout as needed.
4. Click **OK** to save changes and close the dialog.

> [!NOTE]
> If you reduce the number of tiles, all extra tiles will be deleted from the dashboard (beginning with the last tile). The tiles are ordered left to right, top to bottom. If you increase the number of tiles, existing tiles will be rearranged, and new empty tiles will be added.
