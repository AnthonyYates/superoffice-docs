# Duplicate a dashboard

You can create a copy of an existing dashboard. This can be useful if you want to create your own version of a pinned dashboard with some changes of your own.

To duplicate an existing dashboard:

1. Open the **Dashboard** screen.
2. Select the dashboard you want to duplicate.
3. Click the **Task** button, and select **Duplicate dashboard**. The duplicated dashboard opens, with a "2" added after the name.
4. To change the name of the dashboard and adjust other settings, click the **Task** button, and select **Edit dashboard**. See [Create a new dashboard][1].
5. To add, edit or delete tiles, and edit the dashboard layout, click the **Task** button, and select **Add tile / Edit layout**. See [Add tiles / Edit layout][2].
