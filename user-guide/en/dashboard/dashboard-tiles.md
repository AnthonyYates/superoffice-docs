# Working with tiles

A dashboard can consist of any number of tiles. Each tile contains a graphical or numerical representation of SuperOffice data. Below we have described the available options for tiles, when you are not in edit mode.

## View tiles and data

* Click on data in a tile (for instance a sector in a pie chart) to display the underlying data. See [View tile data][1].
* Place the mouse-pointer over a section of a tile to view source data in a pop-up box.
* Click the data labels (legend) under the tile to hide/show specific data in the tiles. This can be useful for printing or exporting the tiles.
* Click ![icon][img1] in the header of a tile and select **View in full screen** to open the tile in full screen. This is especially useful for tiles with much content.

## Export tiles

Click ![icon][img1] in the header of a tile to access the following options:

* **Download PDF document** / **Download PNG document**: Download the tile in PDF or PNG format. The export files are downloaded to your browser (**Downloads** folder).

* **Print**: Open the tile in the print dialog.

> [!TIP]
> To hide specific data before exporting or printing a tile, click the data labels (legend) next to or under the tile to hide data.
