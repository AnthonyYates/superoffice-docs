# Personal profiles

Personal profiles apply to a single user. You configure personal profiles by clicking ![icon](../media/btn_editelementprofile.png) (the "spanner" icon) available in different screens, for example, the list of requests in the **Contact** screen, the request properties section in the **Request** screen or the search results screen. We will use a concrete example to explain how this works. In the example below, we assume that you want to add a field in the **Request** screen. To do this:

1. Open the **Request** screen and select the **Details** tab (see [Process requests](ticket.listTicket.md)).
2. Click ![icon](../media/btn_editelementprofile.png) on the far right of the request's properties. The **Edit element profile** screen appears.
3. Next to **New field** are two empty fields.
    * In the left-hand field enter the field name.
    * Click the list button ( ![icon](../media/btn_dropdown.png) ) next to the field on the right, and select which field in the database you want to get data from.
4. Click **Add** next to the two fields you have just completed. This new field is added under the preview at the top of the screen.
5. Click **OK**. The changes are saved, and the next time you display this screen the new field will be included.
6. If you want to revert to the default settings, return to the **Edit element profile** screen and click the **Restore default (deletes this profile)** button at the bottom of the screen.
