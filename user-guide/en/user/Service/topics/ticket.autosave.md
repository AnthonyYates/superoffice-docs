# ![icon](../media/nav-request.png)Autosave

Whenever you are working on a request and suddenly receive a more urgent request, youâ€™ll have to leave the request you are working on to solve the prioritized request.

The autosave function will automatically save your changes until you click **OK** to send or cancel the changes to your request.

Autosaved information is placed in the local storage of your browser, so your data will even survive a browser crash, reboot, logout and login.

The autosave feature is activated by default when you view and edit requests (including [quick-reply](ticket.newQuickTicket.md) and reply/reply all).

## Limitations

* Autosaved data will not be transferred from one computer to another. This means that you cannot start replying to a request at work, and then continue at home.
* Autosaved data will not be shared between two different browsers.
* The autosave function is a useful feature, but should not replace saving your work the proper way.

> [!TIP]
> If you are using custom screens, you can activate or deactivate autosave. See [Screen properties](blogic.listScreenDefinitions.editScreenDefinition.md).
