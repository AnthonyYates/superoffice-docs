# Customer languages

> [!NOTE]
> This feature requires a licence for SuperOffice Customer Centre.

In the **Customer languages** screen is a list of the installed customer languages. From this screen you can configure the customer languages, making it easy to communicate with customers in different languages.

For example:

* You can have multiple language versions of SuperOffice Customer Centre, the FAQ module and the reply templates.
* You can specify a language for a contact, so that person will automatically receive reply templates in that language.
* Requests to user support can be categorised in several groups that can refer to defined departments and languages.

On installation, 6 customer language folders (DE, DK, EN, NL, NO and SE) were placed in the folder **\\templates** on the server. You need to set up these customer languages in SuperOffice Service yourself.
