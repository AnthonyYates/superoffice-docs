# New quick request

If you are very busy and just need to register a request as fast as possible, use the **New quick request** function:

1. Select **Requests &gt; New quick request**.
2. In the **Title** field, enter a descriptive name for the request.
3. In the **Category** field, select a category for the request.
4. In the **Owner** field, select who should be the owner of the request:
    * If you want to assign the request to a specific person, select the name you require.
    * **(Automatically assigned)**: If you select this option, the system assigns the request in accordance with the applicable assignment rules.
    * **(Unassigned)**: You can also choose not to assign the request. The members of the relevant category then become responsible for dealing with the request.
5. In the **Priority** list box, you can choose between **Low**, **Medium** and **High**, or you can make the system assign the priority automatically. This can be done, for example, on the basis of [escalation levels](admin.listPriorities.editAlert.md) set for different customers.
6. In the **Contact** field, add the contact for the request. <!-- Fix reuse ID=a2 -->
    * To search for a contact, start typing their name. The search starts automatically.
    * If the contact is not recorded in the system, click ![icon][img1] to add them as a new contact. See [Create contacts](../customers/newCustomer.md).

    You can only add one contact to a quick request. To add additional contacts, open the request after you have created it.
7. In the **Message** field, enter the actual message you want to add to the request.
8. Click **OK** to save the request.
