# Efficient handling of requests using AI

> [!NOTE]
>The functions described in this topic require a separate licence for AI services. SuperOffice AI is cloud only and is a separate add-on.

The introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in SuperOffice 10 gives request handlers / support agents a new set of smart tools to make their workday more efficient.

## Language detection

This functionality automatically detects the language of an incoming request. The detected language is displayed under the message.

## Translation

If you receive a message in a language you cannot read, you can click the **Translate from *****language*** below the message. The subject and body of the message will be translated and added below the original message.

## Sentiment analysis

(is the customer happy or angry?)

If this function is active, incoming e-mail requests will be analyzed to determine the "mood" of the customer. An emoticon below the message will indicate the detected sentiment (happy, unhappy or neutral).

## Automatic categorization

Save time by letting the system categorize requests for you. If this function is active, incoming e-mail requests will be analyzed to determine the best category for each request. In the footer of a request, you will see the category suggested by the system. Click the category link to update the request with the suggested category.
