# Users

In the **Users** tab, you can display all the users registered in the system. Using the **Filter** field at the top of the tab, you can apply the following filters to the list:

* **All**: Shows all the users registered in the system.
* **Service users**: Shows all users with an active user licence. In practice, this means all active users.
* **Deleted**: Shows all deleted users. When you delete a user in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance, this person remains in the system, but is marked as deleted. Their history is retained, but by deleting them, you free up a user licence. You can restore a deleted user, i.e. reactivate the user licence, in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.
* **User groups**: If you select a user group, all members of that group are displayed.

Clicking a user takes you to the **Edit users** screen, which contains all the information recorded about this user.

To create, delete or restore users, go to SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.
