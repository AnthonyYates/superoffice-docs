# Create SMS mailbox

SuperOffice Service can import SMS messages. For this to work, you must set up an SMS mailbox:

1. Select ![icon](../../../media/icons/globalmenu-settings-small.png)**System settings** &gt; **E-mail**. This takes you straight to the **Mailboxes** tab.

2. Click **New SMS mailbox**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If an SMS mailbox already exists, the **New SMS mailbox** button is not visible.

3. In the **Category** list box, select the default category to apply to requests created from SMS messages.

4. In the **Priority** list box, select which priority to assign to requests received via SMS.

5. In the **Customer language** list box, specify which language is to be used for the customers who send messages to this mailbox. For more details about this, see [Customer language](admin.listCustLangs.md).

6. Click **OK**. The SMS mailbox is created.
