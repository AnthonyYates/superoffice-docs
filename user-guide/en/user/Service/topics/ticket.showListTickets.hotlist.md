# Add requests to the favourites list

In SuperOffice Service there is a favourites list, to which you can add requests you want to remind yourself to follow up.

**Tip:** You can also add contacts, companies, selections and mailings to your favourites. These favourites can be accessed by clicking the relevant icon in the Navigator and clicking ![icon](../../media/navmenu_favourites.png). See [Favourites](rms.navigate.favourites.md).

## Add requests to the favourites list

<!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->

1. Search for the relevant requests.
2. Click the checkbox next to each request you want to add to the favourites list.
3. Click ![icon](../../media/btn_Menu.png) in the lower left corner of the list.
4. Select **Batch management &gt; Add to my favourites**.

1. Open the request. (See [Process requests](ticket.listTicket.md).)
2. Click the favourites icon ( ![icon](../media/favourite_inactive.png) ) in the request header. The star turns yellow ![icon](../media/favourite_active.png), and the request is instantly added to favourites. You do not have to click **Save**.

**Tip:** Before transferring responsibility for the request to someone else (see [Ask another request handler for help](ticket.showListTickets.askForHelp.md)), it is a good idea to add it to your favourites list, to remind yourself to follow it up. It will no longer be displayed under **Own open requests** when someone else is defined in the **Owner** field.
