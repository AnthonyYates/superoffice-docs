# User groups

Using the **User groups** tab in the **Users** screen, you can collect the users into groups. Users groups can be linked to categories, so that category membership for users is easier to administer.

## Create user groups

To create a new user group:

1. Select ![icon][img1] **System settings &gt; Users**.
2. Select the **User groups** tab.
3. Click the **New group** button. The **User group** screen opens.
4. Fill in the **Name** and **Description** fields.
5. Select the **Categories** tab. Here you can choose which categories the users in the group will be members of. In this way, you can avoid having to state a category membership manually for every single user.
6. Do as follows:
    1. Select a category in the **New category** field.
    2. Click **Add category** or **Add with subcategories**.
7. Click **OK**. The user group is created.

If you want to assign a user to this group, follow the procedure under [Edit users](admin.listUsers.listUsers.editUser.md) and select this group in the **Group** field in the **User information** tab (see [User information](admin.editUser.helpUserInfo.md)). If you wish to assign a user to more than one group, go to the tab **Other groups** (see [Other groups](admin.editUser.helpOthergroups.md)).

## Delete user groups

To delete a user group from SuperOffice Service, do as follows:

1. Select ![icon][img1] **System settings &gt; Users**.
2. Select the **User groups** tab.
3. Click the name of the user group in question. The **User group** screen opens.
4. Click the **Delete** button at the bottom of the screen.
5. If this user group contains users, you must move the users to another group. In the **Move users and subgroups to** list, select the user group to move them to.
6. Click **Delete**.
7. Click **OK** when you are asked if you want to delete the user group. The user group is deleted and all users are moved to the group you selected in step 5.
