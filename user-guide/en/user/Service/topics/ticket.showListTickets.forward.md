# Forward messages to external parties

As a request handler, you, even aided by your colleagues, are not always able to answer a request. Sometimes, you may need to ask for help from others, for example, by getting advice from a sub-supplier. Proceed as follows:

1. Open the request. (See [Process requests](ticket.listTicket.md).)
2. Click the **Messages** tab.
3. Click ![icon][img1] on the message you want to forward, and select **Forward**. A new message opens in edit mode.
4. Add a recipient in the **To** field. Click the **Cc/Bcc** button (on the right-hand side of the message) to add recipients on copy or blind copy.
5. Edit the message. See [Message](ticket.newTicket.md#Message).
6. Click ![icon](../media/msg-attachment.png) in the toolbar and add any relevant documents as attachments to the request.
7. Click **Send**. The message is sent.
