# Delete priorities

You cannot delete priorities from SuperOffice Service, but you can set the status of a priority to **Deleted**, to make it unavailable to users and customers. To do this:

1. Select ![icon](../media/globalmenu-settings-small.png)**System settings** &gt; **Priorities**. The **Priorities** screen appears.
2. Click the required priority. The **Priority properties** screen appears.
3. In the **Status** list box in the **Properties** tab, select **Deleted**.
4. Click **OK**. The priority will then no longer be available, for example, when users create new requests.
