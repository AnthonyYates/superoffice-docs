# ScreenChoosers

[!include[Requirement](../../../includes/req-expander-services.md)]

A ScreenChooser is a script that can perform a redirect to a different screen from the default one. The script can execute the CRMScript "setVariable("url", myUrl)" function to display a different URL from the default one. This applies for example to redirecting from the Show request screen to a custom screen and/or performing calculations in the script before displaying the screen. The ScreenChoosers are organised in a folder structure based on where in the system they are run from.
