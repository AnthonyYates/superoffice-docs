# Search for companies

To find companies that are registered in the system:

1. Select **Customers** &gt; **Find company**. This takes you to the **Criteria** screen.
2. Enter the required search criteria under **Criteria**. See [Search in SuperOffice Service](rms.search.md) to find out how to define search criteria.
3. Click **Search**.
4. Under **Find companies** are the companies that match your search criteria. If you select one of the companies in the list, the requests and contacts linked to that company are displayed in the preview section. <!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->
    If the preview section is not visible, click the ![icon](../../media/btn-Menu.png) menu button in the top right corner and select **Show reading pane to the right** or **Show reading pane below**.

> [!TIP]
> There is a more complete description of what you can do in the **Find companies** screen, under [Search in SuperOffice Service](rms.search.md).
