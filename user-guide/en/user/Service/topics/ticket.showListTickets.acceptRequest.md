# Take responsibility for requests

This is particularly relevant for unassigned requests, i.e. those without a defined owner. If you want to take over a request, it is important to follow the procedure below to identify that you have taken it over. Otherwise there is a risk of others answering the request at the same time. To do this:

1. Open the request. (See [Process requests](ticket.listTicket.md).)
2. Click the ![icon](../media/btn-Menu.png)**Actions** button and select **Accept request**.  
    or  
    In the **Owner** field, select yourself.
