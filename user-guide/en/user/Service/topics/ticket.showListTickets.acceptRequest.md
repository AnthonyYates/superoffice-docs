# Take responsibility for requests

This is particularly relevant for unassigned requests, i.e. those without a defined owner. If you want to take over a request, it is important to follow the procedure below to identify that you have taken it over. Otherwise there is a risk of others answering the request at the same time. To do this:

1. Open the request. (See [Process requests](ticket.listTicket.md).)
2. Click the ![icon](../media/btn_Menu.png)**Actions** button and select **Accept request**.  
    or  
    In the **Owner** field, select yourself.

**Get next request in queue**: If the queue system is set up for your company, you can click this option to get the next unassigned request in the queue for the category you belong to. To set up this feature, see [How to set up Get next request in queue](Get_next_request_in_the_queue.md).
