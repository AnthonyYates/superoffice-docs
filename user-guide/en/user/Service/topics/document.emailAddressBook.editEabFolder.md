# Administrate e-mail address folders

Under **Knowledge Base** &gt; **E-mail addresses** you can create a folder structure for e-mail addresses, to give them a logical structure and make it easy for others to find information. You can create subfolders in all folders, and you can place e-mail addresses in any of these folders as appropriate. Find out more below about how to work with the folder structure.

## Create folders

To create a new folder:

1. Go to the folder you want to create a subfolder under.
2. Click the **New folder** button at the top of the screen.
3. The **Folder** field automatically shows the name of the parent folder you chose. You can select a different folder here.
4. Enter a descriptive name for the folder in the **Name** field.
5. In the **Description** field, enter a brief description of what the folder contains.
6. Click **OK**. The new folder is created.

You are now ready to add e-mail addresses to the new folder. See [Create e-mail addresses](document.emailAddressBook.newEabEntry.md).

## Delete folders

Before you delete an e-mail folder, you need to remove all the addresses in it. You do this in one of the following ways:

* You can delete the addresses as described under [List e-mail addresses](document.emailAddressBook.viewEabEntry.md).
* You can move an e-mail address to another folder by changing the content of the **Folder** field when you edit an address. See [Create e-mail addresses](document.emailAddressBook.newEabEntry.md).

When you are ready to delete the folder itself, do as follows:

1. Go to the required folder.
2. Click the **Edit folder** button.
3. Click **Delete**. The folder is deleted immediately.
