# Delete requests

**Note:** To access this function, your user must belong to a role with the functional right **Service**** administration**.

In general, it is not recommended to delete a request. In some cases, however, you may have to delete a request to comply with your company's privacy policy. All messages and attachments/files linked to the request are also deleted.

In order to do so:

1. Open the request you want to delete. See [Find requests](ticket.listTickets.md).
2. Click ![icon](../media/btn_Menu.png) and select **Edit request**.
3. Click the **Delete** button in the lower right corner.
4. Click **OK**.

> [!NOTE]
> The request is not deleted from the database immediately. The status of the request is set to Deleted, so it is still possible to open and edit the request. The request will then be permanently deleted from the database after x days (system setting).
