# Blocked e-mail

In the **Blocked e-mail** tab is a list of inbound e-mails blocked by an e-mail filter. Click an e-mail to display its contents. If there is insufficient space for all the e-mails on one page, you can click ![icon][img1] to navigate to the next page. This list contains the following columns:

* **When**: Specifies when the e-mail was blocked.
* **Mailbox**: Specifies which mailbox imported the e-mail.
* **E-mail filter**: Specifies which e-mail filter blocked the e-mail.
* **E-mail subject**: Shows the subject of the message.

The following options are also available from the ![icon][img2] menu button:

* **Export**: Click here to export the list to a file. You can choose from these formats: Excel, HTML and plain text.
* **Import**: Click here to import the selected e-mails. The e-mail filter which blocked the e-mail will then be ignored, but other e-mail filters may be enabled.
* **Delete**: Click here to delete the selected blocked e-mails.
