# Work with priorities

The default priorities included with the system are **High**, **Medium** and **Low**. But you can both add new priorities and edit the settings of existing priorities.

## What would you like to do now?

[Create priorities](admin.listPriorities.listPriorities.editPriority.md)

[Delete priorities](admin.listPriorities.listPriorities.deletePriority.md)
