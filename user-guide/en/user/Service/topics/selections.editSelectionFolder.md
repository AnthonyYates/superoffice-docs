# Administrate folders of selections

Under **Selections** &gt; **List selections** you can create a folder structure for the selections, to give them a logical structure and make it easy for others to find information. You can create sub-folders in all folders, and you can place the selections in any of these folders. Find out more below about how to work with the folder structure.

## Create folders

To create a new folder:

1. Click **New folder** at the top of the screen.
2. In the **Folder** field, select a parent folder in the list.
3. Enter a descriptive name for the folder in the **Name** field.
4. Click **OK**. The new folder is created.

## Edit folders

You can edit both the name of a folder and the details you entered when creating it. To do this:

1. Go to the required folder.
2. Click the name of the folder.
3. Amend the fields as described above.
4. Click **OK**. The changes are saved.

## Delete folders

When you delete a folder, all its contents (selections, FAQ entries, reply templates, tables, scripts, macros etc.) are also deleted from SuperOffice Service. To do this:

1. Go to the required folder.
2. Click the name of the folder.
3. Click **Delete**.
4. Click **OK** when you are asked if you want to delete the folder. The folder and its contents are removed from SuperOffice Service.
