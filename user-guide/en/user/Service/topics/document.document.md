# Work with documents

Under **Knowledge Base &gt; Documents** you can add documents to make them available to yourself and/or other users. Such documents might include price lists, installation routines and brochures.

> [!NOTE]
> The difference between **Documents** and **External documents** (see [Work with external documents](document.externalDocument.md)) is that the latter contains files that are accessible to everyone, including unregistered customers.
