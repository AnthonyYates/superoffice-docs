# Roles

**Note:** If this option is not visible, that means you have insufficient rights for this function. Contact your system administrator for more information.

Roles are used as a tool for administrating users. You can link different properties to a role, such as profiles, workflow access and functional rights. When you assign a user to a role, the user automatically acquires these properties. The **Roles** screen displays a list of all available roles.

> [!NOTE]
> If your company uses SuperOffice CRM, the roles are managed from SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.
