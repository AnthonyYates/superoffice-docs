# Reply to customer

In request handling, your most important task is to respond to enquiries. Proceed as follows:

1. Open the request. (See [Process requests](ticket.listTicket.md).)
2. Click ![icon](../media/btn_Menu.png) and select **Reply** or **Reply to all**. The **Message** tab in the **Request** screen appears. The contact is automatically added as a recipient in the **To** field.
3. Type in the message you want to add to the request. See [Message](ticket.newTicket.md#Message).
4. Since this message should be visible to the customer, you need to check that **External** appears in the toolbar at the bottom of the tab.
5. Click ![icon](../media/msg_attachment.png) in the toolbar and add any relevant documents as attachments to the request. See [Message](ticket.newTicket.md#Message).
6. Click **OK**. The message is sent to the customer.
