# Selections

You use selections to create a set of records that you want to work with later on and in other parts of the program. The criteria for selecting these records are highly flexible. A selection could be, for example

* a list of all the requests you have completed this week (so that you can report on them)
* a list of contacts you specially want to follow up
* all open requests for specific categories

The aim is to find out how many records match the specific criteria and to follow them up in an organised way. There are several types of selections:

## **Dynamic selection**

A dynamic selection can be compared to a saved search that is executed each time you view the selection. Each time you add a record that fulfils the search criteria in a dynamic selection, the selection will be updated with the new record, unlike a static selection. You could, for example, create a dynamic selection containing all requests belonging to a specific category and which have a high priority. See [Create a dynamic selection](selections.newSelection.newDynamicSelection.md).

## **Script-based selection**

In a script-based selection, you define a data selection using a CRMScript, which offers almost unlimited possibilities for advanced calculations and criteria for defining the selection. See [Create a script-based selection](selections.newSelection.newScriptSelection.md).

## **Static selection**

A static selection is a list containing only records you have added manually, in contrast to a dynamic selection. Once you have created a static selection and added records to it, it will always contain the same records until you either add or remove some. A static selection works like a report in which you always have full control over the records. See [Create a static selection](selections.newSelection.newStatSelection.md).

## **Combined selection**

A combined selection is a combination of two or more existing selections. Here you can add records from one selection to another, or remove records in one selection from another. This is useful if, for example, you want a selection containing all customers based on specific criteria (dynamic selection), but excluding individual customers (static selection). See [Create a combined selection](selections.newSelection.newCombiSelection.md).
