# Navigate in SuperOffice Service

To move between the parts in SuperOffice Service, you click the buttons in the Navigator on the left of the screen.

<!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->

## Shortcut search

To quickly access a specific record (such as a request or contact), function or screen in SuperOffice Service, use the "shortcut search":

1. Press **CTRL+SPACE** on your keyboard. The shortcut popup shows a fast searcher and all available menu items from the navigator, personal settings and system settings.
2. Enter a search term, such as a function name, request ID, contact name or menu item. The result updates dynamically as you type.
3. Select the result you want to open.

**Tip**: You can also use the [keywords used in the quick search](rms.search.useQuickSearch.md#SearchForOtherRecords) to search for specific items like contacts or companies.

When you click one of these buttons, you get access to various options, such as shortcuts, actions, history, favourites and search. See [Navigator options](Navigator-options.md).
