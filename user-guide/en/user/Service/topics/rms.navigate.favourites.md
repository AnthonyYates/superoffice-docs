# Favourites

The Favourites function gives you easy to access to your favourite records, such as [requests](ticket.showListTickets.hotlist.md), contacts, companies, selections and mailings.

## Add record as a favourite

To add a record to your favourites, open it and click the star icon ![icon](../media/favourite_inactive.png) in the top-right corner. The star turns yellow ![icon](../media/favourite_active.png), and the record is instantly added to your favourites. You do not have to click **Save**.

Now you can quickly access the record by clicking ![icon](../../media/navmenu_favourites.png) in the Navigator menu.

> [!TIP]
> If you hold the mouse pointer over a record in the favourites list, a tooltip is displayed containing additional data about the record.

## Remove record from the favourites list

1. Open the record.
2. Click the favourites icon ( ![icon](../media/favourite_active.png) ) in the header. The icon changes to ![icon](../media/favourite_inactive.png).
