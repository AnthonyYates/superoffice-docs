# Categories

> [!TIP]
> Looking for a more flexible way of organizing your request? Try [using tags in requests](ticket.tags.md).

All requests belong to a category, and each category has its own rules that define how requests are processed in the system. Typically, the higher-level categories will correspond to the organisation's departments, while subcategories will correspond to areas of responsibility and/or logical structures within a department. Subcategories could also be the products that the company sells. An example might be to have the main categories of User Support, Development, Sales and Invoicing - and subcategories in these for each of the products that are sold.

**Disambiguation:** The term "category" is also used for company categories, which are created and maintained in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.

Users can be added as members in the categories individually or via the user group(s) they belong to (see [User groups](admin.listUsers.listUsergroups.md)).

Selecting ![icon][img1] **System settings** &gt; **Categories** takes you to a list of all the categories defined in the system. The categories are arranged in a tree structure.
