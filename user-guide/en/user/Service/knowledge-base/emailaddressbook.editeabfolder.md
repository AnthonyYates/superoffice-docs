# Administrate e-mail address folders

Under **Knowledge Base** &gt; **E-mail addresses** you can create a folder structure for e-mail addresses, to give them a logical structure and make it easy for others to find information. You can create subfolders in all folders, and you can place e-mail addresses in any of these folders as appropriate. Find out more below about how to work with the folder structure.

## Create folders

[!include[How to create a folder](../../includes/howto-create-folder-kb.md)]

You are now ready to add e-mail addresses to the new folder. See [Create e-mail addresses](emailAddressBook.newEabEntry.md).

## Delete folders

Before you delete an e-mail folder, you need to remove all the addresses in it. You do this in one of the following ways:

* You can delete the addresses as described under [List e-mail addresses](emailAddressBook.viewEabEntry.md).
* You can move an e-mail address to another folder by changing the content of the **Folder** field when you edit an address. See [Create e-mail addresses](emailAddressBook.newEabEntry.md).
