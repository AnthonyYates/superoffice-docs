# Global profiles

A global profile is used as the default profile and applies to all those who do not have a personal profile or who have not been assigned a common profile on the basis of the role they belong to. You create this in the same way as a common profile (see [Create common profiles](listprofiles.commonprofiles.md#create-common-profiles)), but you also check **Set as default profile** at the top of the **Edit element profile**.
