# Add requests to the favourites list

In SuperOffice Service there is a favourites list, to which you can add requests you want to remind yourself to follow up.

> [!TIP]
> You can also add contacts, companies, selections and mailings to your favourites. These favourites can be accessed by clicking the relevant icon in the Navigator and clicking ![icon](../../media/navmenu-favourites.png). See [Favourites](../topics/rms.navigate.favourites.md).

## Add requests to the favourites list

<!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->

1. Search for the relevant requests.
2. Click the checkbox next to each request you want to add to the favourites list.
3. Click ![icon](../../../../media/icons/btn-menu.png) in the lower left corner of the list.
4. Select **Batch management &gt; Add to my favourites**.

1. Open the request. (See [Process requests](listTicket.md).)
2. Click the favourites icon ( ![icon][img1] ) in the request header. The star turns yellow ![icon][img2], and the request is instantly added to favourites. You do not have to click **Save**.

> [!TIP]
> Before transferring responsibility for the request to someone else (see [Ask another request handler for help](showListTickets.askForHelp.md)), it is a good idea to add it to your favourites list, to remind yourself to follow it up. It will no longer be displayed under **Own open requests** when someone else is defined in the **Owner** field.

To view the favourites list, do one of the following:

* Select **Requests** in the Navigator, and click ![icon](../../media/navmenu-favourites.png).
