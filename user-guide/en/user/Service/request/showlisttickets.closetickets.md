# Close requests

Once you have responded to the request, you can set its status to **Closed**. This can be done in two different ways:

* When you send the final request to a customer (see [Reply to customer](showListTickets.addMessage.md)), you can also select **Closed** under **Status** in the **Properties** tab.
* You can open a request at any time (see [List requests](listTicket.md)) and select **Closed** in the **Status** list.
* If you forward the request to an external party, who will handle and complete the request, you can select **Close request**. See [Forward messages to external parties](showListTickets.forward.md).
