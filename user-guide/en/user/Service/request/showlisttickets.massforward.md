# Forward multiple requests to external parties

In the request lists, you can forward multiple requests at the same time. To do this:

1. Select the requests you want to forward in the request list.
2. Click the ![icon][img1] menu button in the lower left corner of the request list.
3. Select **Batch management** and **Batch forward**.
4. Under **Choose recipient**, you will find the following:
    * At the top is the e-mail address of the owner of the request and other request handlers who are or have been linked to the request.
    * In the next empty field, you can enter an e-mail address if you want to forward the message to someone who has not already been registered in the system.
5. Check the recipient(s) you want, and click **To**, **Cc** or **Bcc**, depending on which recipient field you want to put them in. The recipients are displayed in the list which appears underneath.
6. If you check **Close request**, the requests are closed once they are forwarded.
7. Under **Comment**, you can enter a comment, which will then be added both to the e-mail message and to the request as an internal message.
8. Click ![icon][img2] in the toolbar and add any relevant documents as attachments to the request. See [Message][1].
9. Click **OK**. The requests are sent.
