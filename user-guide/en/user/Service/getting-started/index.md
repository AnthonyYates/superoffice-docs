| Button | Description |
|---|---|
| ![icon](../../standardcrm/media/navigator-dashboard.bmp) | **Dashboard**: The dashboard provides you with an overview that can be tailored to your needs. See [Dashboard](../request/mainMenu.md). |
| ![icon](../media/nav-request.png) | **Requests**: This is where you manage requests and enquiries that are in the system. You can also create internal and external requests, respond to incoming enquiries and obtain an overview of the statuses of all requests in the system. See [Requests][4]. |
| ![icon](../media/nav-company.png) | **Customers**: Here you can search for and create companies and contacts. See [Customers][1]. |
