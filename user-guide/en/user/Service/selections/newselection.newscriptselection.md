# Create a script-based selection

[!include[Requirement](../../../includes/req-expander-services.md)]

In a script-based selection, you define a data selection using a CRMScript, which offers almost unlimited possibilities for advanced calculations and criteria for defining the selection. You can order a script tailored to your company's needs from SuperOffice or a SuperOffice partner. You can also create a CRMScript yourself. See the [CRMScript documentation][1].

Assuming you already have a script to use as a basis, a script-based selection is created as follows:

1. Select **Selections** &gt; **New selection**. This takes you to the **New selection** screen.
2. In the **Source table** field, select which type of records you want to include in the selection. For instance, if you want to create a selection of requests, select **Request**.
3. Check **Script-based selection**.
4. Click **Continue**. This takes you to the **Edit selection** screen.
5. In the **General info** tab, enter the following:

    [!include[Contents of Selection General info tab](../../includes/selection-general-info.md)]

6. In the **Selection** tab, paste the script into the text field.
7. In the **Profile** tab, specify how the selection is to be presented:
    [!include[Contents of Selection Profile tab](../../includes/selection-profile-tab.md)]
8. Click **Execute** to display the result of the script-based selection in the **Result** tab.
9. Click **OK**. The selection is saved, and you are returned to the **List selections** screen.
