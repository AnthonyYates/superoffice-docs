# Create a selection based on search criteria

The simplest way to create a selection is to base it on a search. This creates a dynamic selection. <!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 --> Proceed as follows:

[!include[Definition of dynamic selection](../../includes/def-dynamic-selection.md)]

Open the search screen. <!-- Fix reuse ID=a2 -->

* You can select **Requests** &gt; **Find requests** to search for requests. See [Search for requests][1].
* You can use predefined lists to search for requests. See [Use lists][2].
* You can select **Customers** &gt; **Find contacts** or **Find companies** to search for contacts and companies.
* In the knowledge base, you can click the **Search** icon ( ![icon](../media/search.png) ) to the right of a folder name to search for different types of content.

Enter or adjust the criteria as described under [Search in SuperOffice Service](../topics/rms.search.md).

Click ![icon](../../../../media/icons/btn-menu.png) &gt; **Save as selection**. The **Edit selection** screen is displayed.

In the **General info** tab, enter the following:

[!include[Contents of Selection General info tab](../../includes/selection-general-info.md)]

In the **Selection** tab you can view the search criteria specified for the selection. If necessary, adjust the criteria as described under [Search in SuperOffice Service](../topics/rms.search.md).

In the **Profile** tab, specify how the selection is to be presented:

[!include[Contents of Selection Profile tab](../../includes/selection-profile-tab.md)]

Click **OK**. The selection is saved, and you are returned to the **List selections** screen. From here you can, for example, update the selection.
