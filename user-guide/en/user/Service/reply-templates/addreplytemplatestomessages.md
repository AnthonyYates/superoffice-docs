# Add reply templates to messages

When you respond to an customer enquiry, you can save time by using a reply template as your basis. To do this:

1. Go to the **Message** tab, as described under [Reply to customer](../topics/ticket.showListTickets.addMessage.md).
2. Position the mouse pointer in the message where you want to insert the reply template.
3. Click the list button ( ![icon](../../../../media/icons/btn-dropdown.png) ), and select what to insert in the message. Optional: Select a language in the language list. If available, the text will be inserted in the selected language. Otherwise the default language will be used. See [Create new language version of reply template](newlangversion.md).
4. In the list that appears, first click **Reply template** and then the entry you want.
5. Click **Paste at cursor position**. The reply template text is inserted.
6. Review the text and make any adjustments.

> [!TIP]
> You can also click ![icon](../media/btn-preview.png)**Preview** to display the selected item onscreen.
