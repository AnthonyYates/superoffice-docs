# Search for FAQ entries

If there are lots of FAQ entries in a folder, it may be difficult to find the one you want. In that case, doing a search may be a good idea. To do this:

1. Select **Knowledge Base** &gt; **FAQ**.
2. Click the **Search** button. This takes you to the **Criteria** screen.
3. Search as described under [Search in SuperOffice Service](../topics/rms.search.md).

> [!TIP]
> Perhaps you should consider creating a folder structure to make it easier to locate relevant FAQ entries? See [Administrate folders of FAQ entries](editKbCategory.md).
