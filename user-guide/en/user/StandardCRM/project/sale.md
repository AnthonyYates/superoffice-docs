# Sales

**Sales** is one of the section tabs at the bottom of the **Project** screen. It contains information about any sales linked to the project.

The columns of the **Sales** section tab contain the following information:

* ![icon](../media/Salg-solgt-detaljkort.bmp) : The first column in the **Sales** section tab specifies the **Completed** status of a sale. A tick in the checkbox (![icon](../media/Utfoert.bmp)) means that the sale is completed, while an empty box means that it is not completed.
* a status icon for the sale, showing whether it is sold ( ![icon](../media/Salg-solgt-detaljkort.bmp) ), lost ( ![icon](../media/Salg-tapt-detaljkort.bmp) ) or stalled ( ![icon](../media/Salg-utsatt-detaljkort.bmp) ) (if there is no icon, the sale is "open") (see [Stalled, sold and lost sales](../sale/Status-of-sale-sold-and-lost.md))
* the date of the sale
* the sale amount
* the current stage of the sale
* the date of the next activity recorded for the sale (the oldest follow-up that has not yet been completed)
* the name of the sale
* the name of the company the sale is linked to
* any contact the sale is linked to

Double-click a sale in the list to open the **Sale** screen in SuperOffice CRM which contains information about that sale. For more details on how to manage sales, see [Sale](../sale/sale.md).
