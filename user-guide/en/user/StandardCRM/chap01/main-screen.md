# The Main screen

The main screen in SuperOffice CRM consists of five main elements:

* **The Navigator**
    The vertical row of buttons on the far left of the screen is called the Navigator. These buttons make it easy to navigate around in SuperOffice CRM. See [The Navigator](Navigator.md) for more information.
* **The Top bar**
    At the very top of the screen is the Top bar. The buttons on the menu bar gives fast and easy access to creating new records and activities, and managing personal settings and various system options. See [Buttons on the Top bar](Buttons-in-the-menu-bar.md).
* **The Main card**
    Towards the top of the screen, just to the right of the Navigator, is the main card. This is a key component of SuperOffice CRM, since this is where you find all the main details of companies, contacts, projects, sales, selections and so on. The main card is named according to the screen you are in, e.g. company card, diary card or project card. See [Company](../chap03/Companies.md), [Contact](../person/Contact-main.md), [Diary](../chap06/Diary.md), [Project](../chap05/Project.md), [Sale](../sale/sale.md) or [Selection](../chap04/Selection.md) for more information.
* **The Side panel**
    At the right side of the screen is the side panel. The side panel is a flexible display window that can be configured in lots of different ways. See [The side panel](Navigating-in-the-mini-card.md) for more information.
* **The Section tabs**
    The section tabs appear below the main card. These contain, for example, lists of contacts, project members and activities that are linked to the relevant record in the main card. For more details of the section tabs, see: [Section tabs in the Company screen](../chap03/Section-tabs-in-the-Company-screen.md), [Section tabs in the Contact screen](../person/Section-tabs-in-the-Contact-screen.md), [List of members](../chap04/The-List-of-Members.md), [Project screen section tabs](../chap05/Project-screen-section-tabs.md), [Sale screen section tabs](../sale/sale-screen-section-tabs.md) and [Activities section tab](../chap06/activities-list.md).
