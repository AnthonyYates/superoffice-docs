## SuperOffice CRM

SuperOffice CRM is easy to get started with. It is extremely user-friendly with many new functions to make your working day more productive.

Both new users and previous users of SuperOffice will benefit from reading this user guide. It gives an overview of the facilities and functions in SuperOffice CRM and explains how the program will benefit you and your company.

## The Idea behind SuperOffice CRM

When we launched SuperOffice in 1990, we wanted to dispel the myth that computers and data are complicated. We wanted to save you from having to incessantly contact your computer manager and, instead, to let you use your time to process information about customers, markets and your own organisation.

The role of SuperOffice CRM is the processing of information in companies, in a system that can be used by a single user or by many users in a network. The SuperOffice CRM platform can be used over the Internet.

SuperOffice has now grown. We have received feedback from satisfied SuperOffice users, and the technology has advanced. SuperOffice CRM is user-friendly, for both new and existing users. The program underpins your work-flow with frequently used features only a click away. The latest version of SuperOfficegives you more facilities than earlier versions, is more flexible and can be customised for the specific methodologies of the different groups in your company.

## The same starting point for many tasks

SuperOffice CRM systematises and simplifies your daily office routines and tasks. From the same screen, it is easy to print letters and create reports.

Using the diary, you always have complete control over your working day and week. You can schedule activities with your colleagues and reserve common resources, e.g. conference rooms.

SuperOffice CRM is your new personal assistant, as it combines all the fundamental tasks you perform on a daily basis. Important and updated information is available to everyone in the company. With just a few clicks of the mouse you have access to reports, appointments, sales reports and marketing campaigns, and you can send e-mail and read information on the Internet. The information structure can easily be adjusted to your company's needs.

With the help of the SuperOffice mobile solutions, you can gain access to the information in SuperOffice CRM regardless of whether you are on a business trip, working from home or at a branch office.

## Common profile

When all employees in the company use SuperOffice CRM, they have access to all the information they need, when and where they need it. SuperOffice CRM increases your teamwork and productivity through shared information. Using document templates gives all outgoing correspondence a consistent and professional appearance.
