# SuperOffice Web Tools

SuperOffice Web Tools maintains the integration with your documents and e-mail. The SuperOffice Web Tools download consists of two components:

* **SuperOffice Web Tools** – which facilitates the integration between browsers, documents and SuperOffice applications.
* **SuperOffice Mail Link** – which gives you the possibility to archive e-mails from your Outlook or Lotus Notes e-mail client.

You will automatically be asked to upgrade or install SuperOffice Web Tools when you log in to SuperOffice CRM through your browser for the first time on your PC. If this welcome screen does not appear or in case you need to download it again, you can start the SuperOffice Web Tools download wizard manually ( ![icon](../../../../media/icons/globalmenu-mainmenu-small.png) **Main menu &gt; Download &gt; SuperOffice Web Tools**).
