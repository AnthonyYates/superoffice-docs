# Favourites

The Favourites function provides easy access to your favourite records, such as companies, contacts, sales, selections, projects, and documents.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also add requests as favourites, and they will be available in the side panel.

To add reports as favourites, see [Favourite reports](../chap09/Favourite-reports.md).

## Add record as a favourite

To add a record to favourites, click the star icon ![icon](../../Service/media/favourite-inactive.png) in the corner of the relevant card, tab or dialog. The star turns yellow ![icon](../../Service/media/favourite-active.png), and the record is instantly added to favourites. You do not have to click **Save**.

Now you can quickly access the record by clicking ![icon](../../media/navmenu-favourites.png) from the Navigator menu. The favourites are also available in the side panel.

In lists (such as the section tabs and Find), you can right-click a record and select **Add to favourites** in the menu.
