# Key functions in SuperOffice CRM

SuperOffice CRM consists of the following main sections which you will quickly become familiar with:

[Dashboard](../Dashboard/Dashboards.md)

[Company](../chap03/Companies.md)

[Contact](../person/Contact_main.md)

[Diary](../chap06/Diary.md)

[Sale](../sale/sale.md)

* [Quote](../quote/quote_main.md)

[Project](../chap05/Project.md)

[Selection](../chap04/Selection.md)

[Inbox](../Inbox_TOP.md)

[Chat](../../Chat/Chat.md)

[Reports](../chap09/Reports.md)

[Marketing](../../Mailing/Helptopics/SO_Mailing.md)

You can easily switch between these screens by clicking the buttons in the Navigator (see [The Navigator](Navigator.md)).

Access to other useful functions is also just a click away thanks to the **New** button (see [The Top bar](Buttons_in_the_menu_bar.md)) and the global buttons (see [Global buttons](Global_Buttons.md)) in SuperOffice CRM.
