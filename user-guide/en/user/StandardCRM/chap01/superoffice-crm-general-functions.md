# Key functions in SuperOffice CRM

SuperOffice CRM consists of the following main sections which you will quickly become familiar with:

* [Dashboard](../Dashboard/Dashboards.md)
* [Company](../company/Companies.md)
* [Contact](../person/Contact-main.md)
* [Diary](../diary/Diary.md)
* [Sale](../sale/sale.md)
  * [Quote](../quote/quote-main.md)
* [Project](../project/index.md)
* [Selection](../selections/index.md)
* [Inbox](../Inbox-TOP.md)
* [Chat](../../Chat/Chat.md)
* [Reports](../chap09/Reports.md)
* [Marketing](../../Mailing/Helptopics/SO-Mailing.md)

You can easily switch between these screens by clicking the buttons in the Navigator (see [The Navigator](Navigator.md)).

Access to other useful functions is also just a click away thanks to the **New** button (see [The Top bar](Buttons-in-the-menu-bar.md)) and the global buttons (see [Global buttons](Global-Buttons.md)) in SuperOffice CRM.
