# Delete items in SuperOffice CRM

> [!NOTE]
> To delete companies or contacts, see [Delete companies](../chap03/Deleting_companies.md) and [Delete contacts](../person/contact_delete.md). See also [Restore deleted companies and contacts](Restore_deleted_companies_and_contacts.md).

When you choose to delete something in SuperOffice CRM, the dialog displays **Delete Appointment**, **Delete Sale**, **Delete Selection** and so on, depending on what you have chosen to delete. The name of the item is displayed in the dialog, so that you can check that you have made the right choice.

> [!TIP]
> To delete a repeating follow-up, see [Stop repeating follow-ups](../chap02/Stopping_recurring_follow-ups.md).

<!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->

If the **Delete** button is disabled (light grey), it means that you have no rights to delete this particular item.

Examples:

* You cannot delete a contact who is also an employee in a SuperOffice company.
* You cannot delete appointments, documents, sales, projects, etc. that do not belong to you, unless you have sufficient user rights to do so.

Below you will find a description of the buttons in the dialog and what effect they have:

**Yes**: Confirms deletion of a single item at a time.

**Yes to All**: Confirms that you want to delete all selected items. If, for example, you have selected five items for deletion, this button will delete them all automatically.

**No**: Cancels deletion of a single item at a time. The dialog is closed without deleting anything.

**Cancel**: Cancels deletion of all selected elements. The dialog is closed without deleting anything.

To suppress this dialog: Check **Do not show this dialog again** at the bottom of the delete dialog.

To reactivate this dialog: Go to ![icon](../media/globalmenu_personalsettings_small.png)**Personal settings &gt; Preferences &gt; Functions** and set the **Show confirmation dialog** option to **No**.

> [!NOTE]
> When you delete a company, a selection or a project, you are always asked to confirm the deletion, and the **Do not show this dialog again** option is not available.
