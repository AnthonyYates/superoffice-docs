# Using wild cards

Use **%** as a wild card when searching. The percent character (%) matches any string of 0 or more characters. For example: J%son matches Jackson, Johnson, Jason, and Json.

To search for a first AND middle name or for a contact with two last names, enter an underscore between the names. Example: "Carl\_Martin" or "Jennings\_Fletcher". The underscore functions as a wild card.
