# Search options

SuperOffice CRM contains several different search tools:

* If you click the **Find** button on the top bar, you open the [Find screen](Find_dialog.md), where you can search for data in SuperOffice.
* You can use [FastSearcher](Using_FastSearcher.md) or the [history list](Using_the_history_list.md) to search for companies, sales, projects and selections.
* You can use [freetext search](Freetext_search.md) to search for any text which users have entered in SuperOffice CRM
