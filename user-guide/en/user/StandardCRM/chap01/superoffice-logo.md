# The SuperOffice logo

At the top left in SuperOffice CRM is the SuperOffice logo, which has the following functions:

<table>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><p>![icon](../media/Superoffice-logo.bmp)</p></td>
<td><ul>
<li>If you click the logo, the SuperOffice Community website is displayed.</li>
<li>If you hold down **CTRL** while clicking the logo, you go to the main company, i.e. the one you yourself are part of. (The main company is a preference which you can change; see [Preferences](Preferences.md)).</li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
