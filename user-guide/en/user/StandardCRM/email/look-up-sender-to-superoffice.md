# Look up sender in SuperOffice

You can easily look up information about a sender in SuperOffice CRM.

Follow these steps:

1. In the inbox, select an e-mail.
2. Click the sender's name and e-mail address in the e-mail header.
3. What happens next, depends on whether the sender's e-mail address is found or not found in SuperOffice:
    * If the e-mail address is found on a company/contact, the company/contact card is displayed.
    * If the e-mail address is registered on more than one company/contact, a dialog will appear, listing the alternatives and allowing you to choose one of them.
    * If the e-mail address is not registered in SuperOffice CRM, you can click **Create new company and contact**. See [Add e-mail addresses in SuperOffice CRM](Adding-email-addresses-in-CRM.md).
