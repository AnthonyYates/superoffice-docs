# Archive outgoing email

To send a message and archive it as a document in SuperOffice CRM, click **Send and archive** when you are writing an email message. See [Compose an email][1].

> [!TIP]
> If you do not archive the message when you send it, you can still go to the sent folder and archive the message as described in [Archive incoming email][2].
