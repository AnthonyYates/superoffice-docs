# Create an actor in the ERP system

[!include[Requirement](../../includes/req-integration-server.md)]

If you want to connect, for example, a SuperOffice company to a customer in the ERP system, and this customer does not exist in the ERP system, you can create the customer in the ERP system based on the data from SuperOffice.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Create** button is disabled if SuperOffice is not allowed to create actors in the ERP system.

[!include[To do this](../../../includes/to-do-this.md)]

1. Open the **Connect to ERP** dialog as described in [Connect to ERP][1].
2. Select **Can't find match in ERP** at the bottom of the **Connect to ERP** dialog, and click **Create**. The **Create in ERP** dialog appears.
3. Enter the values as required.
4. Click **Create**. This takes you back to the **ERP** tab where the synchronised data will now be displayed.
5. Click **Save**.
