# Using sales targets in tiles

If you have defined sales targets for your company, teams/groups and/or sales people (see [Sales targets](../sale/Sales-targets.md)), you can add these targets to your dashboard tiles. You will then get a visual presentation of your actual sales and your targets.

To add a tile with sales targets to a dashboard:

1. Open the **Dashboard** screen.

2. Select the dashboard you want to edit.

3. Click the **Task** button, and select **Add tile / Edit layout**. On the right side of the selected dashboard, the **Add tile / Edit layout** section is displayed.

4. In the **Show tiles for** list, select **Sale**.

5. In the **Library** tab, select one of the following charts:

    * ![icon](../media/Dashboard-Images/dashboard-tiletype-bignumbers.png) - Big number

    * ![icon](../media/Dashboard-Images/dashboard-tiletype-bar.png)- Bar chart

    * ![icon](../media/Dashboard-Images/dashboard-tiletype-column.png)- Column chart

    * ![icon](../media/Dashboard-Images/dashboard-tiletype-gauge.png)- Gauge chart

    * Empty sale tile

    > [!TIP]
    > You can also select an empty tile to create a tile from scratch, but the chart type needs to be one of those listed above. See [Edit a tile](Dashboard-Tiles-Edit.md).

6. To add a tile to the dashboard, drag and drop it on the desired position on the dashboard. You can also click **Add** to add a tile to next available position. The tile will automatically adjust to the available space, and will align with the grid and columns setup.

7. Adjust the tiles on the dashboard as follows:
    * Hold the mouse-pointer over a tile and click and drag the frame to adjust the tile size. Available slots/spaces in the dashboard will be highlighted in yellow when the tile can fit in that position.
    * Click the header of a tile and drag it to another position.

8. In the dashboard, click the **Edit tile** icon ( ![icon](../media/Dashboard-Images/dashboard-tile-edit.png) ) on the tile you have added.

9. In the **Dataset** tab, set **Sale date** to this year, quarter or month. Edit the other criteria as necessary. Remember to update the tile name to reflect any changes made here. See [Use search criteria](../chap01/Using-search-criteria.md).

10. In the **Layout** tab you need to edit the layout as follows:
    * **Chart type**: You can change this to any chart type listed in step 5.
    * **Measure**: Select **Sum**.
    * **Of**: Select **Amount** or **Weighted amount**.
    * **By**: Select **Sale &gt; Owner** (owner, full name or group) or **Sale &gt; Sale date**.
    * **Period** (only relevant if you selected **Sale date** above): Select year, quarter or month.
    * **Grouping**: Select **Compare to target**. If this option is not visible or is inactive, double-check that you have performed the steps above.

11. Edit the formatting. Depending on which chart type you have selected, you have additional options under **Formatting**:
    * Big number: You can edit the colours used to display sales targets.
    * Gauge chart: Usethe option **Mark target at** to set the sales target on the gauge chart.

12. Click ![icon](../media/Dashboard-Images/tile-icons/translate.png) to add a translation to the tile name, titles and labels. See [Translation](../Translate-fields.md).

13. Click **Save**.

14. Click **Done** when you have completed the dashboard.
