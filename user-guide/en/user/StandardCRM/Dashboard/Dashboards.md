# Dashboard

> [!NOTE]
>Some of the functions described here, require specific functional rights or licences.

The **Dashboard** feature in SuperOffice CRM gives you quick access to the charts, reports and statistics that are most important to you. You can choose from a wide range of pre-defined charts, and also add charts from dynamic selections or create your own.

Dashboards are displayed as tabs at the top of the screen. Pinned dashboards and dashboards set as favourite are displayed here, in addition to the most recently used dashboard (that is not pinned or set as favourite). To view other dashboards to which you have access, search in the navigator.

Each chart in a dashboard is presented as a tile. A dashboard can contain multiple tiles.

The tiles can also be customized to show only data from selections. Access rights and confidentiality apply to the tile data, so tiles will only display information you have access to. Tile data typically relates to you, or your groups, and to a specific period (this month, last 6 month, etc.)

There are several types of tiles: column, bar, area and pie charts, column+line charts and bar+line charts, lists,; and key numbers and big numbers.

## Options in the Dashboard screen

Pinned dashboards are displayed with a pin icon (![icon](../media/Dashboard_Images/dashboard_pinned.png)). This usually means that this is a dashboard that has been distributed to multiple users by an administrator.

Dashboard favourites are displayed with a star icon (![icon](../media/Dashboard_Images/dashboard_favourite.png)). You can click this icon in the top-right corner to set a dashboard as favourite.

Click the **Refresh** button ( ![icon](../media/Dashboard_Images/dashboard_refresh.png) ) to update the data in all tiles.

Click the **Task** button to access the following functions:

* [Create a new dashboard](Dashboard_Create.md)

* [Duplicate a dashboard](Dashboard_duplicate.md)

* [Edit a dashboard](Dashboard_Edit.md)

* [Add tiles / Edit layout](Dashboard_Add_Tiles.md)

* [Delete a dashboard](Dashboard_Delete.md)
