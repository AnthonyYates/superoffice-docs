# Add tiles / Edit layout

To add tiles to a dashboard:

Open the **Dashboard** screen.

Select the dashboard you want to edit.

Click the **Task** button, and select **Add tile / Edit layout**. On the right side of the selected dashboard, the **Add tile / Edit layout** section is displayed.

In the **Show tiles for** list, select the type of records you want to use, for instance companies, follow-ups or sales. Relevant tiles are displayed in the **Library** and **Selections** tabs below:

* **Library**: This tab contains a set of pre-defined tiles from the online template library. The icon next to the tile name indicates the tile type.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can also select an empty tile to create a tile from scratch. See [Edit a tile](Dashboard-Tiles-Edit.md).

* **Selections**: This tab contains dynamic selections with charts (see [Charts](../chap04/Display-selections-as-charts.md)), and will only show selections of the same record/entity type selected in the **View** list above (e.g. company, sale etc.). Please note that when using a selection chart, the dataset is copied, and any changes to the selection will not be reflected in the tile.

Optional: Use the search field to find specific tiles.

To add a tile to the dashboard, drag and drop it on the desired position on the dashboard. You can also click **Add** to add a tile to next available position. The tile will automatically adjust to the available space, and will align with the grid and columns setup.

Repeat steps 4-6 to add more tiles.

Adjust the tiles on the dashboard as follows:

* Hold the mouse-pointer over a tile and click and drag the frame to adjust the tile size. Available slots/spaces in the dashboard will be highlighted in yellow when the tile can fit in that position.
* Click the header of a tile and drag it to another position.

Click **Done** when you have completed the dashboard.
