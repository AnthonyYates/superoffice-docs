# Edit and delete standard reports

You can neither edit nor delete the standard reports themselves. What you can do however is to save a standard report as a favourite report and then adjust the search criteria as you wish (see [Add favourite reports](Adding-favourite-reports.md) and [Edit search criteria in reports](Editing-search-criteria-in-reports.md)).
