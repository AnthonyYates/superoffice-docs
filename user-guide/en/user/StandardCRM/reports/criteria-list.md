# Criteria list

The criteria list is located in the upper half of the **Reports** screen, next to the report list and below the report description. It contains criteria that apply to the report you have selected in the report list. Here you can add or delete criteria by clicking the **Add** or **Delete** buttons, and you can edit a criterion by double-clicking it.

Click the **Add to favourites** button to add the report with the specified criteria to the report list in the **Favourites** tab. See [Favourite reports](Favourite-reports.md) for more information.
