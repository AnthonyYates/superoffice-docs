# The report archive (Documents)

The report archive (the **Documents** section tab) appears at the bottom of the **Reports** screen. It contains previously generated reports which have been saved as documents. In this section tab, you can open, edit, delete and [filter](Using-Filter-function-Reports.md) saved reports. You can also export a list of reports.

> [!TIP]
> Saved reports are listed with **Report** in the **Type** column on the **Activities** section tab in the **Company**, **Contact**, **Sale** and **Project** screens. (See [Activities in SuperOffice CRM](../diary/index.md)).
