# Diary

The diary in SuperOffice CRM is used much like a filofax and has separate pages for every day, week and month.

The diary is a useful tool when you want to plan and perform different types of tasks. From the diary, you can view, edit and delete activities. (See [Manage follow-ups in the Diary](Managing_follow-ups_in_the_diary.md) and [Activities in SuperOffice CRM](../chap02/Activities_in_SuperOffice_CRM.md)).

You also get a list of sales to work on, using the **Sales** section tab in the **Diary** screen (see [Sales secretary](Sales_secretary.md)).

The **Diary** screen consists of two main sections:

* A calendar showing follow-ups that have been allocated to a particular time or date. (See [Tabs in the Diary screen](Tabs_in_the_Diary_screen.md)).
* A section tab area, which comprises the activities list (see [Activities section tab](activities_list.md)) and the sales list (see [The Sales section tab](Sale_card.md)).

At the bottom left of the calendar is a field for selecting a time zone, if time zones have been enabled in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance (see [Time zones](Time_zones.md)).
