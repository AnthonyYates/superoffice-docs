# Move follow-ups using drag and drop

**Note**: You can only edit follow-ups where you are the owner. If you are viewing another associate's diary, you can only edit follow-ups where the selected associate is the owner.

At some time, you will undoubtedly need to move follow-ups from one time slot to another, from the activities list to the **Diary** screen, or from the **Diary** screen to the activities list. These actions can be accomplished quickly and easily in SuperOffice CRM by dragging and dropping with the mouse.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only move one follow-up at a time, and only follow-ups that are not completed. (See [Change Completed status of an activity](../chap02/Marking_activities_as_completed_not_completed.md).)
