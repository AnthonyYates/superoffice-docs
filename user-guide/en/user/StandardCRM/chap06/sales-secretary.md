# The Sales secretary

The **Sales** section tab in the diary functions as a kind of "sales secretary" to help you keep an overview of your sales â€“ the activities you are planning and those you have forgotten to do. In this way, the **Sales** section tab is a sales-oriented task list, which shows you the following:

* All uncompleted sales where the sale date is within the defined display range.

* All sales with planned activities for a specific number of days ahead.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The number of days ahead, based on the next activity date, is defined in the **Preferences** dialog. Go to ![icon](../../../../media/icons/globalmenu-personalsettings-small.png)**Personal settings &gt; Preferences**. Select **Functions** &gt; **Show days ahead**.

* All sales with overdue activities, i.e. which have an end date earlier than today. These sales are shown in red.

* Stalled sales where you have set a reopen date. The reopen date overwrites the date in the **Next activity** field and is displayed in the **Next activity** column on the **Sales** section tab. (For more information on stalled sales, the reopen date and next activity, see [Stalled, sold and lost sales](../sale/Status-of-a-sale-sold-and-lost.md).)
