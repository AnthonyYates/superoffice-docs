# Create follow-ups from the Diary

When you are in the diary, there are several ways to create follow-ups.

* Click the time at which you want the follow-up to start and hold the mouse button down while you drag the mouse to the required end time for the task. A blue area is displayed while you define the time slot; the follow-ups dialog then opens.
* Double-click a time in the Diary. The follow-ups dialog is displayed with a default duration for the follow-up.
* Right-click a time in the Diary and select **New**. The follow-ups dialog is displayed with a default duration for the follow-up.
* Double-click an empty line in the **Activities** section tab at the bottom of the **Diary** screen. The follow-ups dialog opens.
* Click **New** in the top bar and cliselect **Appointment**, **Phone Call** or **Task**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you create the appointment from the **View** tab (see [The View tab](View-Tab.md)), you can choose to have the **Participants** dialog automatically filled out with the members of the view. To set this option, go to ![icon](../media/globalmenu-personalsettings-small.png)**Personal settings &gt; Preferences &gt; Functions** and set the **Participants from group view** preference to **Yes**. Click **Save**.
