# The Week tab

The **Week** tab displays one week at a time. It is divided into columns, one for each day of the week.

To open the **Day** tab for a particular day, click the relevant day heading.

> [!NOTE]
> You can define whether Sunday or Monday should be considered the first day of the week under ![icon](../media/globalmenu_personalsettings_small.png)**Personal settings &gt; Preferences**.

Along the left-hand edge of the **Week** tab, there are hourly intervals. You can scroll up and down the time intervals.
