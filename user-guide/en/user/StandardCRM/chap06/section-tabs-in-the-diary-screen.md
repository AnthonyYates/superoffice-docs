# Section tabs in the Diary screen

The **Diary** screen contains the following section tabs:

[Activities](activities-list.md): The **Activities** section tab gives you an overview of activities and acts as a to-do list or task list.

[Sales](Sale-card.md): The **Sales** section tab shows essential information about sales.

Additionally, you can define in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance (**Lists &gt; GUI - Web panel)** that more section tabs will be added in the form of URL addresses which SuperOffice CRM links to. You then open the URL address by clicking the tab itself. Here you can click **Open in separate window** to view the web page in a separate browser window.
