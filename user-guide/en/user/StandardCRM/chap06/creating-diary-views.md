# Create group views

In SuperOffice CRM, you can add a selection of users and resources in your organisation to a view. You can name and save this view in the **Views** list box, as follows:

1. Click the **View** tab in the **Diary** screen.
2. Click the **Task** button at the bottom right and choose **New group view**. The **New group view** dialog opens.

> [!TIP]
> To edit an existing view, click **Edit**, and to copy an existing view, click **Copy**.

1. Entered the appropriate information in the **Name** and **Description** fields.

2. Choose whether to view the diaries for **Associates**, **Project** or **Resource** in the **Select from** field.

3. The contents of the list box immediately below the **Select from** field vary depending on what you have selected under **Select from**.
    * If you selected **Associates**, a list of user groups in your organisation is displayed. You can also select **All** if you want to display all the users in the organisation.
    * If you selected **Project**, the history list of projects is displayed.
    * If you selected **Resource**, a list of resource groups in your organisation is displayed. This list is defined in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance. Select **All** if you want to see all the resources in your organisation.

4. Select the users/resources you require and click the right arrow ( ![icon](../media/Pil-hoeyre.bmp) ) to add them to the pane on the right. You can also select users and resources individually by double-clicking them.

5. The pane on the right displays all the users and resources you have added to the group view. If you want to remove a user or a resource from this list, select it and click **Delete**.

6. The users and resources you have chosen will be displayed in the group view in the same order as in the pane on the right. To change this order, select a user or resource and click arrow up ( ![icon](../media/Pil-opp.bmp) ) or arrow down ( ![icon](../media/Pil-ned.bmp) ) to move it up or down.

7. Click **Save** when you have finished selecting users and resources, or click **Cancel** to close the dialog without saving.

You will then be returned to the **View** tab, where you can create appointments for associates, and so forth.

For more information about the fields in this dialog, see [The New group view dialog](View-dialog.md).

> [!TIP]
> If you want to delete the active group view, click the **Task** button at the bottom right and select **Delete group view**.
