# Create follow-ups in the activities list

To create a new follow-up directly in the activities list, double-click an empty row below the last activity in the list.

If no empty row is displayed at the bottom of the activities list, enlarge the activities list, as follows:

1. Position the mouse pointer between the section tabs and the card above. The pointer changes to a double-headed arrow.
2. Click and drag the line upwards until you see more empty rows at the bottom of the activities list.

> [!NOTE]
> If you specify a time or duration for a follow-up you are creating from within the activities list, it will be entered in the Diary.
