# Tabs in the Diary screen

The diary consists of four different tabs which you can select simply by clicking them at the top of the **Diary** screen.

Click the word **Diary** in the Navigator and select a time period from the list that appears.

You can create, edit, move and delete follow-ups directly in these tabs (see [Manage follow-ups in the Diary](Managing_follow-ups_in_the_diary.md)). Click and drag a follow-up to reschedule it.

Follow-ups with times are displayed as boxes in the different views in the **Diary** screen, with information about the company and the type of follow-up. The following icons are also displayed:

<table>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>![icon](../media/Recurring_booking_assignment.bmp)</p></td>
<td>Means that this is a repeating follow-up. See [Create repeating follow-ups](../chap02/Creating_recurring_follow-ups.md).</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>![icon](../media/Vis_som_gruppe.bmp)</p></td>
<td>Means that the follow-up has several participants. See [Invite your associates to a follow-up](../chap02/Creating_follow-ups_with_your_associates.md).</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>![icon](../media/utfoert_dagbok.bmp)</p></td>
<td>Means that the follow-up has been completed: See [Change Completed status of an activity](../chap02/Marking_activities_as_completed_not_completed.md).</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>![icon](../media/followup_details_alarm.bmp)</p></td>
<td>Means that the follow-up has an active alarm.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>![icon](../media/diary_unansweredinvitation.png)</p></td>
<td>Means that there are unanswered invitations for this follow-up. See [Status of invitations](../chap02/Status_of_invitations.md).</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>![icon](../media/videomeeting_diaryicon.png)</p></td>
<td>Means that this follow-up is a video meeting. See [Work with video meetings](../chap02/video_meetings.md). To join the meeting, right-click the follow-up and select **Join meeting**.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

By default, the follow-ups are displayed as a blue field in the diary tabs. If you hold the mouse pointer over one of these fields, a tooltip is displayed showing more information about the follow-up. You can also double-click the blue field to open the follow-up.

> [!NOTE]
> In SuperOffice Settings and maintenance, you can define that all follow-ups of a specific type will be displayed in the **Diary** screen in SuperOffice CRM with a different background colour from the usual blue.
