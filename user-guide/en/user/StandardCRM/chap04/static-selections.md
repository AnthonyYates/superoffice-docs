# Static selections

A static selection contains only the members you have added individually or by searching, in contrast to a [dynamic selection](Dynamic-selections.md). Once you have created a static selection and added members to it, it will always contain the same members until you either add or remove some. Use a static selection if you want to maintain absolute control at all times of its members.
