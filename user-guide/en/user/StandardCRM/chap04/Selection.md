# Selection

In SuperOffice CRM, you can create selections of records/data that you work a lot with. If you also have a licence for the quote module, you can create selections of products as well.

> [!TIP]
> You can create charts from selections and also use selections to create mailings.

All the selections also contain an overview of companies and contacts linked to the records in the selection, e.g. companies and contacts linked to the sales in a sale selection.

In SuperOffice CRM you can create a selection of almost anything. The purpose of the examples below is to provide you with some ideas of how to use this functionality in the program.

## Company

You can create a selection that contains

* all the companies in a specific geographical region
* all the companies where you have defined *Christmas card* or *newsletter* as an interest.

> [!NOTE]
> In all the selections below, a section tab is also displayed, containing companies and contacts linked to the entries in the selection. These might be, for example, customers linked to the sales in a sales selection.

## Sale

You can create a selection that contains

* a list of all your own sales with the status **Lost** or **Sold**
* all sales for the entire sales department in the current quarter

## Project

You can create a selection that contains

* all active projects you are participating in
* all projects with a specific status or of a specific type

## Document

You can create a selection that contains

* all the contracts you have registered in SuperOffice CRM
* a list of all the documents that do not have the status **Completed**

## Follow-up

You can create a selection that contains

* a list of all follow-ups for the same customer last year, e.g. if they are considering signing a framework agreement with your company
* all follow-ups of a specific status or for a specific customer

## Products

You can create a selection that contains

* a list of all customers who have purchased a specific product or a specific product category
* a list of all products sold this year, based on sales which contain quotes and have the status **Sold**

## Requests

You can create a selection that contains

* a list of open request with priority **High** for your department (category)
* a list of open request that have not been updated for over a week

## Form submissions

You can create a selection that contains

* non-processed form submissions for your customers

## Chat conversations

You can create a selection that contains

* your chat conversations
* your customers' chat conversations with specific ratings

## Mailings

You can create a selection that contains

* mailings with a specific open-rate or click-rate
* mailings with high bounce rates

There are three different types of selections in SuperOffice CRM:

* Static selections, which contain only the members you have added manually or via Find.
* Dynamic selections, which will always be updated automatically with members that match the selection criteria.
* Combined selections, which are combinations of two existing selections.

The **Selection** screen contains the following tabs:

* [The list of members](The-List-of-Members.md): All selection types except **Company/contact** will have two tabs containing selection data. Selection members can be projects, sales, documents, requests, follow-ups, form submissions, chat conversations, mailings or products.
* [Company/contact](selection-tab-Company-contact.md): The **Company/contact** tab contains companies and contacts linked to list of members. Example: All contacts or companies linked to the sales in a selection.
* [Criteria](selection-tab-Criteria.md): Here you can edit the criteria for a dynamic selection.
* [Details](selection-tab-Details.md): Here you can edit general information for a selection.
* [Charts](Display-selections-as-charts.md): Here you can view the selection data in a chart. Charts of selections can also be used in [dashboards](../Dashboard/Dashboard-Create.md).
* [Mailings](Mailings-section-tab.md): Here you can create a mailing to contacts in a selection. You can also see the mailings that have been archived on this selection.

To move backwards and forwards between selections:

* click the previous/next buttons ( ![icon](../media/Pil-venstre.bmp)![icon](../media/Pil-hoeyre.bmp) ) at the top right of the screen

## Add record as a favourite

To add a record to favourites, click the star icon ![icon](../../Service/media/favourite-inactive.png) in the corner of the relevant card, tab or dialog. The star turns yellow ![icon](../../Service/media/favourite-active.png), and the record is instantly added to favourites. You do not have to click **Save**.

Now you can quickly access the record by clicking ![icon](../../media/navmenu-favourites.png) from the Navigator menu. The favourites are also available in the side panel.

## Tasks

From the **Tasks** button (lower part of the screen), you can perform specific tasks on the members of a selection, e.g. send an e-mail to contacts linked to the sales in the selection. See [Perform tasks using selections](Performing-tasks-using-selections.md).
