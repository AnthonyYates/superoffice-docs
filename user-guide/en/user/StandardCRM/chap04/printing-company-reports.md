# Print company reports

From time to time you may find it useful to be able to produce a printout of selected companies, for example, if you need a list of all your customers.

1. Follow the procedure described under [Perform tasks using selections](Performing_tasks_using_selections.md), and select the **Company/contact** tab.
2. Click the **Task** button and select **Print company reports**. The process runs in the background, allowing you to continue working. A PDF is generated.
3. Open the PDF and print it.
