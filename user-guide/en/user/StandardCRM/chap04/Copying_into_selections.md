# Copy into selections

This function is useful if you want to copy specific selection members into another selection, for example, if you have created a selection of customers and want to include suppliers in the same selection.

1. Follow the procedure described under [Perform tasks using selections](Performing_tasks_using_selections.md).

2. Choose the **Copy into selection** task.

3. The **Copy into Selection** dialog opens. There are two options in this dialog:
    * **Copy into existing static selection**: select this option to copy the active selection into an existing static selection. In this case, specify the required selection.  
        <!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->
        You cannot copy a selection to an existing dynamic selection or combined selection. So you will only have the option of selecting from existing static selections.
    * **Copy into new selection**: select this option to create a completely new selection containing the members of the active selection. In this case, you must also specify a name for the new selection, what type of selection it is and for whom it will be visible. For more information on completing the fields, see [Create selections](Create_selections.md).  
        <!-- Fix reuse ID=a2 -->
        Since a dynamic selection does not contain any physical contacts, but just a set of search criteria, it is only when you copy a dynamic selection that you can choose between **Static** and **Dynamic** in the **Selection is** list box. If you copy a static selection, the **Selection is** list box will only contain the **Static** option.

        If you want to create a copy of a dynamic selection, you can use the **Copy the selection** function on the **Task** tab.

4. Click **OK**. The selection is copied to the specified destination.
