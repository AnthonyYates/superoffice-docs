# Tabs in the Selection screen

The **Selection** screen contains the following section tabs:

* [The list of members](The_List_of_Members.md): All selection types except **Company/contact** will have two tabs containing selection data. Selection members can be projects, sales, documents, requests, follow-ups, form submissions, chat conversations, mailings or products.
* [Company/contact](selection_tab_Company_contact.md): The **Company/contact** tab contains companies and contacts linked to list of members. Example: All contacts or companies linked to the sales in a selection.
* [Criteria](selection_tab_Criteria.md): Here you can edit the criteria for a dynamic selection.
* [Details](selection_tab_Details.md): Here you can edit general information for a selection.
* [Charts](Display_selections_as_charts.md): Here you can view the selection data in a chart. Charts of selections can also be used in [dashboards](../Dashboard/Dashboard_Create.md).
* [Mailings](Mailings_section_tab.md): Here you can create a mailing to contacts in a selection. You can also see the mailings that have been archived on this selection.

> [!TIP]
> Click ![icon](../../media/btn_columnheaderoptions.png) on the far right of the column headers in a selection. Here you can group and filter records, and add/remove columns. These settings can be saved for the active selection by selecting **Save columns for current selection only**. See also [The section tabs](../chap01/The_Section_tabs.md) for addtional functions.
