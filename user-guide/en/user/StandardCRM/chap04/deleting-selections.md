# Delete selections

To delete an existing selection:

1. Open the **Selection** screen.  
    <!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->
    There are several ways to open the **Selection** screen:

    * By clicking the **Selection** button in the Navigator.
    * By using the history list (see <a href="../chap01/Using_the_history_list.md" style="background-color: Transparent;">The History list</a>) or FastSearcher (see <a href="../chap01/Using_FastSearcher.md" style="background-color: Transparent;">FastSearcher</a>).
    * By double-clicking on a selection in a search result.
2. Go to the required selection. You can, for example, search as described under [Use the Find screen](../chap01/Find_dialog.md).
3. Click the **Task** button.
4. Select **Delete this selection**.
5. When you are asked if you really want to delete the selection, click **Yes**. (For more details about this, see [Delete items in SuperOffice CRM](../chap01/Deleting_elements_in_CRM.md).)
