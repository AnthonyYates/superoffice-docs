# Export to file

Using this task, you can create a text file containing information about the selection members for use outside of SuperOffice CRM. It can be used both for members which are companies (on the **Companies** section tab) and members which are sales, projects, documents or follow-ups. The template you select in the **Use template** field determines what information is included, the order it is displayed in and the separator character to use.

1. Follow the procedure described under [Perform tasks using selections](Performing-tasks-using-selections.md).

2. Click the **Task** button and select **Export to file**. The **Export to file** dialog opens.

3. In the **Use Template** field, you can specify the template to use for the file you are exporting. The template determines what is exported. If you do not want to use the default option, you can choose another template from the list box.

<!-- -->

1. Click **Create** to set the export running.

2. When the export has finished, save or open the file.

> [!NOTE]
> The text file may appear somewhat untidy if you open it in Notepad. This is normal for files where the information is delimited using separators such as TABs, semi-colons, etc.
