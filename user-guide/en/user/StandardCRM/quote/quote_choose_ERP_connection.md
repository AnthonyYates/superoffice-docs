# Select ERP connection

If the **Select ERP connection** dialog is displayed when you are creating a quote, this may be due to:

* No price lists being available for the currency of the sale. You need to select another currency for the sale, or create a price list with the desired currency in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.

> [!NOTE]
> If the list of currencies is not displayed next to the sale amount, you may have to enable use of currency. You can do this from **Preferences** &gt; **Enable use of currency** in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.

* SuperOffice CRM is connected to one or more ERP systems, and there are several relevant ERP connections to choose between. The ERP connection determines where the product information and prices are obtained from.

Once you have selected an ERP connection, you can continue to [create a quote](quote_create.md).
