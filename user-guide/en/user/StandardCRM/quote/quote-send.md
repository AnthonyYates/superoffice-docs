# Send a quote

Once you have added products to the quote and created a quote document, you can send the quote to the customer.

[!include[To do this](../../../includes/to-do-this.md)]

1. Open the quote in question.
2. Click **Send**. The **Publish/send a quote** dialog appears.
    <!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->
    You cannot send a quote if it needs to be approved (see [Approve quote before sending][1]) or contains errors or warnings (see [Deal with warnings and messages when adding products to a quote][2]).
3. If required, edit the validity of the quote in the **Valid to** field. The number of days until the quote expires is shown on the right of the field.
4. Select the required template for the quote in the **Quote layout** field.
5. Click in the **Language** field to choose which language to send the quote in.
6. If your quote contains alternatives, you can select **Use favourite alternative only** to include only this alternative. Otherwise all alternatives will be included in the quote.
7. In the **Publish** field, choose one of the following:
    * **Send as e-mail and archive as PDF**. You have to choose an e-mail template in the list.
    * **Archive as PDF only**. You have to send the quote to the customer yourself.
8. Check **Follow-up** if, for example, you want to create a reminder to yourself to follow up the quote. Select the date for the follow-up, and enter a follow-up text.
9. Click **Preview** to view a PDF version of the quote before you send it.
10. Click **OK** when you have finished. If you opted to send the quote via e-mail, the **New e-mail** dialog appears. Here you can edit the text and send the quote to the customer. If the archive option is on, the **Document** dialog opens.

The quote is marked as **Sent** and is archived as a PDF document in the **Activities** section tab.
