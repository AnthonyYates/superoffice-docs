# Add several products to a quote

If advanced searching is supported, you have the option of searching for and adding several products simultaneously.

Do as follows:

1. Click **Add** at the bottom of the **Products** tab in the **Edit quote** dialog.
2. Start typing a product name in the **Product search** field to search for a product. Click the search icon ( ![icon](../../media/globalmenu-search.png) ) to search for products using a variety of different criteria, for example, by product range, product groups/categories, name, item codes etc. The search includes all active price lists with the applicable currency. For more about search functions, see [Use the Find screen](../chap01/Find-dialog.md).
3. Once you have found the products you want to add to the quote, select them (**Ctrl+click**), and click **OK**. The products are displayed in the **Products** tab (or in the tab for the alternative you have created).
4. Double-click a product to change the quantity, discounts, etc. For more details, see [Add/edit a product in the quote](quote-add-edit-product.md).
