# Create a quote document

<!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->

If have created a quote document for a quote, but want to use another document, you can do as follows:

1. Open the quote.

2. Click the ![icon][img1] **Task** button and select **Change quote document**.

3. Select the quote document in the list.

> [!NOTE]
> The list displays all quote documents registered for the active sale.

Once you have created the quote and added the products you want, you can create the quote document to send to the customer. This will be the "letter" that is sent to the customer. The list of products that are being offered will be added when the quote is sent to the customer.

[!include[To do this](../../../includes/to-do-this.md)]

1. Open an existing quote, or create a new one. See [Create a quote][1].
2. Click **Click to create quote document** at the top of the quote or on the **Quote** section tab. The **Document** dialog opens.
3. Complete the fields with the required information. See [The Document dialog][2] for an explanation of what to enter here.
4. Click the **Create** button to create a new document based on the selected document template.
5. Type in the document content, and save and close it in the usual way in the program. The document is then displayed on the **Activities** section tab in the **Sale** screen (and in the **Company** and **Diary** screens).

> [!TIP]
> There is a list of the variables you can insert into documents you create. You can find the variables in [Template variables][3].
