Each tab consists of the following:

* A report list showing available reports. This list is always at the top left of the screen.In the **Favourites** tab, this list shows the favourite reports, while in the other tabs, it shows all published reports. See [Report list](Report-list.md) for more information.

* A thumbnail of the report. [The thumbnail](Showing-report-properties.md#Rapporttyper) is located on the far right of the **Reports** screen and indicates the selected report type: label, list, group list, cross table, calendar or text export.
