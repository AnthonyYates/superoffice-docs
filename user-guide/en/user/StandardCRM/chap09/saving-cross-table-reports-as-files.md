# Save cross table reports as files

Saving reports as files works slightly differently for cross table reports than for other types of report. To save a cross table report as a file, see [Display cross tables](Displaying-cross-tables.md).

> [!TIP]
> If you are not sure if your report is a cross table, you can check the image at the top right in the **Reports** screen. For more information about this, see **Report types** under [Show report properties](Showing-report-properties.md).
