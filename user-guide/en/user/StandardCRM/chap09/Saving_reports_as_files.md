# Save reports as files

You can save generated reports as documents, so they can later be opened from the report archive (see [Manage saved reports](Managing_saved_reports.md)) or from the **Activities** section tab. The reports are saved as PDFs.

> [!NOTE]
> Saving reports as files is managed slightly differently for cross table reports than for other types. See [Save cross table reports as files](Saving_cross_table_reports_as_files.md).

1. Open the **Reports** screen.  
    <!-- Fix reuse ID=a2 -->
    To open the **Reports** screen:
    * By clicking the **Reports** button in the Navigator.
2. Select the required report (see [Show report properties](Showing_report_properties.md)).

> [!TIP]
> To see on screen what the finished report will look like, use the preview function (see [View reports](Viewing_reports.md)).

1. Click the **Save** button under the criteria list. The **Document** dialog opens.

> [!NOTE]
> If the report is of the type label, you need to specify a label layout in the **Choose label** dialog before the **Document** dialog is displayed.

1. Enter the required information about the report. See [The Document dialog](../chap02/Document_dialog.md).
2. Click **Create**. The file is opened in the default PDF viewer and simultaneously saved in SuperOffice CRM.
