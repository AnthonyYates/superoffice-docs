# Edit search criteria in reports

You can edit search criteria in favourite reports. Standard reports cannot actually be edited, but you can customise the search criteria in them and save them as your own favourite reports (see [Add favourite reports](Adding-favourite-reports.md)).

To edit search criteria in reports:

1. Open the **Reports** screen.  
    <!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->
    To open the **Reports** screen:
    * By clicking the **Reports** button in the Navigator.

2. Select a tab. The reports are displayed in the report list.

    > [!NOTE]
    > It is not recommended that you run reports without specifying search criteria, as this may generate extremely large reports and result in time-consuming processing.

3. Select the required report from the list.

4. In the criteria list, double-click the criterion you want to edit.

5. The **Add/edit search criteria** dialog appears.

6. Edit the required information as described under [Use search criteria](../chap01/Using-search-criteria.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > The criteria you can choose from vary according to the tab and report you have selected.

7. Click **OK** at the bottom of the **Add/edit search criteria** dialog when you have finished.

To see an example of how to edit and delete search criteria in a report, see [Edit search criteria - an example](Example-change-search-criteria.md).
