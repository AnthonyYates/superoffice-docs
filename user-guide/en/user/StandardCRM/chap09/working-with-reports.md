# Work with reports

In the **Reports** screen, you can both define search criteria for reports (see [Favourite reports](Favourite-reports.md)) and use standard reports (see [Standard reports](Standard-Reports.md)).

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot add completely new search criteria to SuperOffice CRM. The search criteria are defined in advance for the various report types, and you can only edit their values and variables and save them as favourite reports. If you want to add new search criteria and create new standard reports, you will need to purchase SuperOffice Reporter Studio.
