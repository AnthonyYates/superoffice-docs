# Display labels

> [!TIP]
> If you are not sure if your report is a label format, you can check the image at the top right in the **Reports** screen. For more information about this, see **Report types** under [Show report properties](Showing-report-properties.md).

1. Open the **Reports** screen.  
    <!-- Fix reuse ID=a2 -->
    To open the **Reports** screen:
    * By clicking the **Reports** button in the Navigator.

2. Select the required report (see [Show report properties](Showing-report-properties.md)).

3. Click the **Preview** button under the criteria list.

4. In the **Choose label** dialog, select the required label format.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also add, edit and delete label formats. This is described under [Add label formats](Adding-label-formats.md), [Edit label formats](Editing-label-formats.md) and [Remove label formats](Removing-label-formats.md).

5. Click **OK**. A PDF is generated in your browser.

6. Open the PDF file. The file is opened in the default PDF viewer.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you do not have a PDF viewer, you will be asked if you want to install one.

7. You can save the PDF file from the PDF viewer, so you can open it later.
