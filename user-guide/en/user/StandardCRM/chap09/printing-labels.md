# Print labels

The print options for labels are slightly different from those for other report types because of the special label format.

1. Open the **Reports** screen.  
    <!-- Fix reuse ID=a2 -->
    To open the **Reports** screen:
    * By clicking the **Reports** button in the Navigator.

2. Select the required label report (see [Show report properties](Showing-report-properties.md)).

3. Click the **Preview** button under the criteria list.

4. In the **Choose label** dialog, select the required label format.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also edit an existing label format to use for printing (see [Edit label formats](Editing-label-formats.md)) or add a new label format (see [Add label formats](Adding-label-formats.md)).

5. Click **OK**. A PDF is generated in your browser.

6. Open the PDF file. The file is opened in the default PDF viewer.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you do not have a PDF viewer, you will be asked if you want to install one.

7. Click the print button in the PDF viewer.
