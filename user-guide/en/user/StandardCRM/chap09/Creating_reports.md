# Create reports

In the **Reports** screen, you can only run previously defined reports (see [Run reports](Running_reports.md)); you cannot define completely new reports.

To save a report as a document (type = Report) in SuperOffice CRM, click the **Save** button in the **Reports** screen. See [Create new documents](../chap02/Creating_new_documents.md).

You can define new reports in SuperOffice Reporter Studio and import them in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance (**Options** &gt; **Reports**).

However, if you want to create a separate report, you can alter the search criteria in an existing report and save it as your own favourite report. For more information, see [Edit search criteria in reports](Editing_search_criteria_in_reports.md) and [Add favourite reports](Adding_favourite_reports.md).
