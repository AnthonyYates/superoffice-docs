# Send e-mail to contacts (Company screen)

1. Go to the required company in the **Company** screen. (See [Use the Find screen](../chap01/Find-dialog.md).)

2. Select the **Contacts** section tab.

3. Select one or more contacts.

4. Right-click and select **Send e-mail**. A message to the specified recipient(s) is then opened in your default e-mail program.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Only contacts with e-mail addresses are displayed in the **To** field. Contacts without e-mail addresses are omitted.

5. Write the e-mail.

6. Send the e-mail by clicking one of the following buttons:
    * Send: The e-mail is sent and will be available in the **Activities** section tab.
    * Send and archive: The e-mail is sent and saved as a document. See more information below.

7. If you selected **Send and archive**, the **Document** dialog opens when you send the e-mail. Add information in this dialog as necessary (see [The Document dialog](../chap02/Document-dialog.md)).

8. Click **Create** in the **Document** dialog.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also send e-mail to a contact by clicking directly on the e-mail address for this person in the **Contacts** section tab (see [Columns in the Contacts section tab](Columns-in-the-Contacts-section-tab.md)).
