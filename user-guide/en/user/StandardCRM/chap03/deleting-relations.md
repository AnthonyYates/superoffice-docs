# Delete relations

You can delete relations which have been set up, as follows:

1. Go to the required company in the **Company** screen. (See [Use the Find screen](../chap01/Find-dialog.md).)
2. Right-click the required relation on the **Relations** section tab and select **Delete**. The **Delete Relation** dialog opens.
3. Click **Yes** to confirm that you really want to delete the relation. (For more details about this, see [Delete items in SuperOffice CRM](../chap01/Deleting-elements-in-CRM.md).)
