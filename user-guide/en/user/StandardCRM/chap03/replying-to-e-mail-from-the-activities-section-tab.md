# Reply to e-mail from the Activities section tab

E-mail messages that are saved as documents for a specific company are displayed on the **Activities** section tab for that company. To reply to an e-mail of this kind:

1. Go to the required company in the **Company** screen. (See [Use the Find screen](../chap01/Find-dialog.md).)
2. Select the **Activities** section tab.
3. Select the required e-mail message.
4. Right-click and choose **Reply**. A message addressed to the person who sent you the original message is opened in your default e-mail program.
5. Enter the required information.
6. When you have finished the message, and want to send it, you have the following options:
    * To send the message straightaway, click the **Send** button.
    * To send the message and archive it as a document in SuperOffice CRM, click **Send and archive**. The **Document** dialog opens. See [Create new documents](../chap02/Creating-new-documents.md).
