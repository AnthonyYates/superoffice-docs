# Delete companies

To delete a company and associated data:

1. Go to the required company. (See [Use the Find screen](../chap01/Find_dialog.md).)
2. Click the ![icon](../../Service/media/btn_Menu.png)**Task** button and select **Delete &lt;company name&gt;**.
3. The **Delete Company** dialog opens. Click **Yes** to confirm that you really want to delete the company. (For more details about this, see [Delete items in SuperOffice CRM](../chap01/Deleting_elements_in_CRM.md).)

**Note**: You can restore companies and contacts that have been deleted by mistake, either by yourself or another user. Deleted companies and contacts are by default kept in the recycle bin for 14 days. After this time, they are permanently deleted. See [Restore deleted companies and contacts](../chap01/Restore_deleted_companies_and_contacts.md).
