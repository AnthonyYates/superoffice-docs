# Send privacy confirmation e-mail

From the **Contact** screen you can resend the privacy confirmation e-mail to a contact. The privacy confirmation e-mail is normally sent automatically to a contact when they are registered in SuperOffice. With this function you can send the confirmation e-mail to existing contacts that have never received the confirmation e-mail.

<!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->

The privacy confirmation e-mail will normally inform the contact of the following:

* Their information has been stored in SuperOffice
* What type of information has been stored
* What the information is used for (purpose)
* That they can withdraw consent whenever they like
* That the information is secure and will not be shared

The e-mail can also contain a link to a customer centre where the contact can manage subscriptions and consent. The link is valid for 21 days by default.

To send the privacy confirmation e-mail to a contact:

1. Go to the required contact in the **Contact** screen. (See [Use the Find screen](../chap01/Find-dialog.md).)
2. Click **Task** ( ![icon](../../media/btn-Menu.png) ) &gt; **Send privacy confirmation e-mail**.
3. In the dialog that opens, fill in the following fields:
    * **Send to**: Use the default e-mail address or select another address.
    * **Use template**: Select an e-mail template.
    * **Language**: Use the default language or select one of the available languages.
    * **Subject**: If relevant, edit the default subject of the e-mail.
4. Click **Send**.

The confirmation e-mail is sent to the contact. The e-mail is archived in the **Activities** section tab.
