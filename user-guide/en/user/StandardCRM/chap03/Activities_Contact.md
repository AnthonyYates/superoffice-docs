# Activities (Company screen)

The **Activities** section tab in the **Company** screen contains all the activities linked to the active company.

There are different types of activities: <!-- Fix reuse ID=a3 -->(including reports and e-mail), <!-- Fix reuse ID=a2 -->(appointments, phone calls and tasks), mailings, form submissions and chat records. These are created by clicking the **New** button in the [top bar](../chap01/Buttons_in_the_menu_bar.md), or created in other SuperOffice products such as Marketing or Chat. For more details, see [Activities in SuperOffice CRM](../chap02/Activities_in_SuperOffice_CRM.md).

The columns of the **Activities** section tab contain the following information:

* ![icon](../media/Utfoert.bmp) : The first column in the **Activities** section tab specifies the **Completed** status of an activity. A tick means that the activity is completed, while an empty box means that it is not completed. For more details on the **Completed** status, see [Change Completed status of an activity](../chap02/Marking_activities_as_completed_not_completed.md).
* The second column contains icons that indicate the activity category, for example ![icon](../media/Type_samtale.bmp) for a phone call.
* <!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->:
* Date information:
    * Documents: Shows the date when the document was recorded.
    * Follow-ups: Shows the date when the follow-up takes place.
* What type of activity it is, corresponding with the above-mentioned type icons.
* A description of the activity.
* Any contact included in the activity.
* Any project the activity is linked to.
* The ID of the person who created the activity.
