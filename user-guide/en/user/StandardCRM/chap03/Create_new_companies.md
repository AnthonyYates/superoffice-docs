# Create new companies

In the **Company** screen you can enter information about companies on several levels, represented by the three **Company**, **More** and **Interests** tabs. To insert a comment on a company, use the **Note** tab.

## Add record as a favourite

To add a record to favourites, click the star icon ![icon](../../Service/media/favourite_inactive.png) in the corner of the relevant card, tab or dialog. The star turns yellow ![icon](../../Service/media/favourite_active.png), and the record is instantly added to favourites. You do not have to click **Save**.

Now you can quickly access the record by clicking ![icon](../../media/navmenu_favourites.png) from the Navigator menu. The favourites are also available in the side panel.
