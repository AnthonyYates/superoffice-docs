# Create new contacts (Company screen)

To create a new contact:

1. Go to the required company in the **Company** screen, select the **Contacts** section tab and click the **Add** button below the section tab. This opens the **Contact** screen.

1. In the top section of the tab, you enter the following information:

    * Contact's first name and/or last name. Mandatory: You must enter either a first name or a last name.
    * Salutation (***Mr/Ms***)
    * Company. Select a company in the list or start typing a company name to search. If the contact should not be connected to a company, select **(No Selection)**.
    * Contact image. You can add a photo by dragging the image file from Windows Explorer and dropping it on the image field at the top left of the tab.

    You can also add a picture by right-clicking the picture field at the top left of the tab. Click the link and browse to the picture you require and click **Open** to add the picture.

2. Enter contact information in the **Contact** tab. See [The Contact tab](../person/contactcard-tab-contact.md).

3. Go to the **Details** tab. Here you can enter additional information for the contact. See [The Details tab](../person/contactcard-tab-details.md).

4. Go to the **More** tab. This tab contains user-defined fields for the contact. See [The More tab](../person/contactcard-tab-more.md).

5. Go to the **Interests** tab. Here you can set interests and e-marketing/subscription options for the contact. See [The Interests tab](../person/contactcard-tab-interests.md).

6. Go to the **Note** tab. Here you can enter information of any kind. See [The Note tab](../person/contactcard-tab-note.md).

7. Go to the **www** tab. See [The www tab](../person/contactcard-tab-www.md).

8. Click **Legal basis** at the bottom of the contact card. The **Privacy** dialog opens. Review and edit the consent information as necessary. See [Edit privacy settings for a contact](Edit-legalbase.md). Click **Close** when you are done.

9. Check **Former employee** (at the bottom of the contact card) if this contact has stopped working for the company. A contact who is recorded as a former employee is not normally displayed in the lists of contacts or project members.

10. When you have entered the necessary information, click the **Save** button. The contact information is then saved in the database and displayed in the contact card. If you have linked the contact to a company, the contact will be displayed in the **Contacts** tab in the **Company** screen.

11. Go to the **Relations** section tab. Here you can add relations between this contact and another contact or company. See [Add relations](../person/contact-secttab-relations-add.md).
