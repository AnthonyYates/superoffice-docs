# Edit companies

To change information entered for existing companies:

1. Go to the required company. (See [Use the Find screen](../chap01/Find-dialog.md).)
2. Click **Edit**.
3. When you have made the necessary changes, click **Save** to close and save. Click **Cancel** if you want to reject your changes.

> [!TIP]
> If the **Save** button is disabled, this means there are one or more mandatory fields that have not been filled out.
