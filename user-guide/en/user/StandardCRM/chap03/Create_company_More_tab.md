# The More tab (Company screen)

1. Go to the **More** tab. This tab contains user-defined fields for companies. If, for example, your organisation needs to have fields for the number of employees in the company or for its turnover, you can specify in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance that these fields are to be inserted here.
2. Enter the information.
3. Click **Save** to save the information you have entered, or click the **Interests** tab to enter information about the company's interests.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also edit the company information in the **More** tab by clicking **Edit**.
