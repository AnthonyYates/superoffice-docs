The **Projects** section tab shows all the projects for the active company. To display a project here, at least one employee in the relevant company must be registered as a project member.

Click **Add** to create a new project. For more details on how to manage projects, see [Project](../chap05/Project.md).

Double-click a project in the list to open the **Project** screen in SuperOffice CRM which contains information about the active project.

The columns of the **Project** section tab contain the following information:

* Check mark indicating if the project has been completed.
* The name of the project.
* What type of project it is.
* The project's status.
* The project number.
* The project description (if any). Hold the mouse-pointer over the paper-clip icon ( ![icon](../media/Binders.bmp) ) to display the description.
* Any link to a web page the project is connected to â€“ a URL address to click on to go to the relevant web page.
* User ID for the person who created the project.

> [!TIP]
> You can configure the columns on the section tab to display just the information that interests you. See [Configure columns](../chap01/Changing-the-column-view.md).
