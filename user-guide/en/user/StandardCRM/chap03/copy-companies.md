# Copy companies

At some stage, you may want to copy an existing company to a new company. For example: an existing company has set up a new branch. The new branch will use mostly the same company information as the existing one.

To copy the company:

1. Go to the required company. (See [Use the Find screen](../chap01/Find-dialog.md).)

2. Select **Manage companies** from the ![icon](../../media/btn-Menu.png)**Task** button, and click **Copy company**.  
    The **Copy company** dialog opens. The source company is specified under **From**.

    <!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->

3. Enter the name of the new company and, where appropriate, a department under **To**.

4. Under **Copy contacts with all information**, you can choose from:

    * **Do not copy**. If you select this option, the company details are copied, but not the contacts.
    * **Copy**. If you select this option, the company details and the contacts are copied.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you want to see the results before you copy the company, click **Show results**: ![icon](../media/Vis-resultat.bmp)

5. Click **Copy**. The new company is created with the specified information, and is given its own number and code. You can then edit the company information if required (see [Edit companies](Editing-companies.md)).

> [!NOTE]
> Activities, sales, interests, project membership and selection membership are not copied.
