# Create mailings

You can send a mailing to all contacts in a selection. The mailing can be an e-mail, an e-mail attachment (document) or an SMS.

1. Open the selection you want to use for the mailing.

2. Click the **Task** button.

3. Click one of the following options:

    * **Create e-mail mailing**: Select this options to send e-mails to all or parts of your customer base. See [Step 1: Setup - E-mail](../../marketing/step-1-setup-email.md).

    * **Create SMS mailing**: Select this option to send SMS messages to all or parts of your customer base by mobile phone. See [Step 1: Setup - SMS](../../marketing/Step-1-Setup-SMS.md).

    * **Create document mailing**: Select this options to create merged documents (PDFs) to print and send by regular mail to all or parts of your customer base. See [Step 1: Setup - Document](../../marketing/Step-1-Setup-Document.md).

    > [!TIP]
    > These options are also available from the **Marketing** button in the navigator.

In SuperOffice CRM, the mailing will be added to the **Mailings** section tab in the **Selection** screen. This will help you keep track of all mailings related to each selection.
