# Delete records permanently

If you want to delete multiple records (contacts, companies, sales, projects etc.), you can create a selection of these records and delete them in one operation.

> [!NOTE]
> This task is only available for users with administrator access. It is also a task you should think about carefully before performing, because it deletes all selected records permanently, both from the **Selection** screen and from the SuperOffice database.

1. Open the **Selection** screen.  
    <!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->
    [!include[Howto](../../includes/goto-selections.md)]
2. Go to a selection. You can, for example, search as described under [Use the Find screen](../key-functions/Find-dialog.md).
3. If you want to delete just some of the selection members, select them in the list of members.
4. Click the **Task** button and select **Delete all**.
5. When you are asked whether you want to delete the records, click **Yes**.
6. When you are asked whether you really want to delete the records from the database, click **Yes**.
