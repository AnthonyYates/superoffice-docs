# Company/contact

The **Company/contact** tab contains companies and contacts linked to the list of members. If the selection is a selection of companies/contacts, this is the only tab with members.

## The Task button

![icon](../media/task.png)

Use the **Task** button to perform different tasks for the members or some of the members of the selection. Examples: sending e-mails, mass-editing and exporting. Which tasks are displayed depends on what type of records the selection consists of (what is selected in the **Selection of** field).

## Other buttons

* **Remove members**. This option is only available for static selections. See [Remove members from static selections](Removing-members-from-static-selections.md). To remove specific members of the selection, select the relevant members, right-click and select **Remove**.

* **Count: number**, The number of members in the active selection.

* **Show all**. Click here to display all selection members. <!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->

    By default the list only displays the 100 first records in the selection. To change this value, go to ![icon][img1] **Personal settings &gt; Preferences &gt; Functions &gt; Archive page size**.
