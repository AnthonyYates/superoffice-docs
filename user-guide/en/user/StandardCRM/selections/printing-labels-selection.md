# Print labels

Label printing will come in handy, for example, when you have to send out letters to many recipients in one go and need to produce address labels to stick on all the envelopes.

1. Follow the procedure described under [Perform tasks using selections](Performing-tasks-using-selections.md), and select the **Company/contact** tab.

2. Click the **Task** button and select **Print labels**. The **Choose label** dialog opens.

3. Select the label format you require and click **OK**. A PDF is generated.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In this dialog you can also add new label formats as well as edit and delete existing ones. This is described under [Add label formats](../chap09/Adding-label-formats.md), [Edit label formats](../chap09/Editing-label-formats.md) and [Remove label formats](../chap09/Removing-label-formats.md).

4. Open the PDF and print it.
