# Search options

SuperOffice CRM contains several different search tools:

* If you click the **Find** button on the top bar, you open the [Find screen](Find-dialog.md), where you can search for data in SuperOffice.
* You can use [FastSearcher](Using-FastSearcher.md) or the [history list](Using-the-history-list.md) to search for companies, sales, projects and selections.
* You can use [freetext search](Freetext-search.md) to search for any text which users have entered in SuperOffice CRM
