# The SuperOffice logo

At the top left in SuperOffice CRM is the SuperOffice logo, which has the following functions:

![icon](../media/Superoffice-logo.bmp)

* If you click the logo, the SuperOffice Community website is displayed.
* If you hold down **CTRL** while clicking the logo, you go to the main company, i.e. the one you yourself are part of. (The main company is a preference which you can change; see [Preferences](Preferences.md)).
