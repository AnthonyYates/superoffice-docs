# The side panel

The side panel appears at the right side of SuperOffice CRM. The panel is available in all screens except for the **Inbox**.

It works as a window to relevant information in SuperOffice CRM. You can choose from a number of different views by clicking the arrow (![icon][img3]) to the right of the side panel's view name.

> [!TIP]
> You can hide or show the side panel by clicking these buttons above the side panel: ![icon](../../media/panel-right-hide.png) ![icon](../../media/panel-right-show.png)

The side panel is useful for showing information complementary to the screen you are in. For example, you can display the monthly calendar at the same time as you are viewing the daily calendar in the **Diary** screen, to give you a better overview, or you can show the members of a selection linked to a project you are looking at in the **Project** screen.

> [!TIP]
> You can also add custom views to the side panel, from SuperOffice Settings and Maintenance.

The default setting is for the side panel to show a preview of the selected record. Once you have selected a view in a tab in a screen, SuperOffice CRM remembers this the next time the same tab is displayed.

You can choose from the following views. Click the views for more information.

* <!-- Fix reuse ID=a8 -->
    Shows a summary of information about the current company in the **Company** screen.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you want to view other companies, without having to switch companies in the **Company** screen, you can use the [history list](Using-history-list.md), which you bring up by clicking the arrow ( ![icon][img3] ) next to the company name.
* <!-- Fix reuse ID=a9 -->
    Shows information about the contact selected in the **Company** or **Selection** screen.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you click the contact's name, the [contact card](../../person/contact-create-contacts.md) opens, and here you can view and edit detailed information about the contact.

    ![icon](../media/question.bmp) <!-- Fix reuse ID=a2 -->

    In a dynamic selection, you can choose to show companies only, without specifying a contact. If **Include main contact** is not checked in the dynamic selection (see [Creating dynamic selections](../../selections/Creating-dynamic-selections.md)), no information will be displayed in the **Contact** view for the side panel, even if you have selected a contact.
* <!-- Fix reuse ID=a3 -->
    Shows a day's agenda which works in the same way as the [Day](../../diary/day-tab.md) tab in the [Diary](../../diary/diary.md) screen

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can only show your own diary in the side panel. If you want to view other people's diaries, you can do this in the [Diary](../../diary/diary.md) screen.
* <!-- Fix reuse ID=a5 -->
    Shows a monthly agenda, giving you an overview of follow-ups for the next month(s). You can expand the side panel to show multiple months.

    If you hold the mouse pointer over these days, a tooltip containing a list of the relevant follow-ups appears.

    | ![icon](../media/minicard-level.png) | The "bar" below the date indicates the level of activities that day, making it easier to schedule meetings. |
    | ![icon](../media/minicard-today.png) | Today. |
    | ![icon](../media/minicard-selected.png) | The selected date in the Diary. |

    You can move from month to month by clicking the arrow keys ( ![icon][img1] ![icon][img2] ) at the bottom of the side panel.
* <!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->
    Shows all your favourites.

  * To view only favourites for the current screen, click the checkbox at the bottom of the side panel. Example: If the **Sale** screen is open, click **Sales only** to show only sales.
  * To remove favourites, select one or more favourites in the list and click **Remove**.
  * Click **Refresh** to update the list of favourites with any new favourites you have added.
  * Right-click a favourite to open the context menu.
  * See also [Favourites](Favourites.md).
* <!-- Fix reuse ID=a4 -->
    Show a daily agenda for the next day. This works in the same way as the **Day** view.
* <!-- Fix reuse ID=a7 -->
    Opens the [Notepad](Notepad.md) in the side panel.
* <!-- Fix reuse ID=a6 -->
    Shows a preview of a selected activity, project, contact, project member or selection member in the side panel. Depending on the selected item, the window may contain links to contacts and activities. Clicking one of these links, opens the [contact card](../../person/contact-create-contacts.md), [Document dialog](../../diary/document-dialog.md), or [follow-ups dialog](../../diary/dialog-for-followups.md), where you can view and edit the contact or activity.
* <!-- Fix reuse ID=a10 -->
    Shows a summary of information about the current project in the **Project** screen.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you want to view other projects, without having to switch projects in the **Project** screen, you can use the [history list](Using-history-list.md), which you bring up by clicking the arrow ( ![icon][img3] ) next to the project name.
* <!-- Fix reuse ID=a11 -->
    Shows a list of project members in the current project in the **Project** screen.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you double-click the name of a project member, the [contact card](../../person/contact-create-contacts.md) opens, and here you can view and edit detailed information about the project member.
* <!-- Fix reuse ID=a16 -->
    Shows a summary of information about the current sale in the **Sale** screen.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you want to view other sales, without having to switch sales in the **Sale** screen, you can use the [history list](Using-history-list.md), which you bring up by clicking the arrow ( ![icon][img3] ) next to the name of the sale.
* <!-- Fix reuse ID=a13 -->
    Shows a summary of information about the current selection in the **Selection** screen.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you want to view other selections, without having to switch selections in the **Selection** screen, you can use the [history list](Using-history-list.md), which you bring up by clicking the arrow ( ![icon][img3] ) next to the selection name.
* <!-- Fix reuse ID=a14 -->
    Shows a list of members of the current selection in the **Selection** screen.
* <!-- Fix reuse ID=a12 -->
    Shows a weekly agenda, giving you an overview of follow-ups for the current week.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you are in the **Diary** screen and select a date in the different week in the diary, the week view changes to the week the selected date is in.
* <!-- Fix reuse ID=a15 -->
    In SuperOffice Settings and maintenance, you can also define your own views for the side panel. This is described in more detail in the SuperOffice Settings and maintenance help.
