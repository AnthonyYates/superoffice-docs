# Record a sale

In the **Sale** screen you can enter information about sales on several levels, represented by the **Sale**, **Details**, **Links** and **Note** tabs.

To edit an existing sale, browse to the sale and click **Edit** at the bottom of the **Sale** screen.

> [!NOTE]
> When you browse through sales using the arrow keys (or similar) and when you search for sales using FastSearcher, by default all sales are displayed. If you do not want to show completed sales (i.e. ones that are sold or lost), click ![icon][img1] **Task** and select **Skip completed sales**.
