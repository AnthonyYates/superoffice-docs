# Show all follow-ups and documents

By default, the activities for the current sales stage are shown in the lower half, but you can choose to show all activities and documents for all stages by checking **Show all stages** at the bottom right of the section tab. You can also show the follow-ups and documents for one of the stages by clicking the button with the name of the stage.

You can go to the next stage by selecting it in the **Stage** list on the main card.
