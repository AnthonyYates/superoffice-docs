# The Activities section tab

The **Activities** section tab shows all activities that are linked to the active sale, i.e. appointments, tasks, phone calls, documents and e-mails. Double-click an activity in the section tab to view or edit it, as required.

## Columns in the Activities section tab

The following columns are displayed on the **Activities** section tab:

* ![icon](../media/Salg_solgt_detaljkort.bmp) : **Completed** status of an activity. A tick in the checkbox (![icon](../media/Utfoert.bmp)) means that the activity is completed, while an empty box means that it is not completed. For more information about how to change this status, see [Change Completed status of an activity](../chap02/Marking_activities_as_completed_not_completed.md).

<!-- -->

* The second column contains icons that indicate the type of activity, one category for each of the different types. For example, a telephone icon indicates a phone call. These icons reflect the text in the **Type** column.
* <!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->
    <table style=" vertical-align:top; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px; left:0px; top:0px; width:100%; max-width:417px;" data-cellspacing="0">
