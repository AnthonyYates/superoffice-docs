# The Activities section tab

The **Activities** section tab shows all activities that are linked to the active sale, i.e. appointments, tasks, phone calls, documents and e-mails. Double-click an activity in the section tab to view or edit it, as required.

## Columns in the Activities section tab

The following columns are displayed on the **Activities** section tab:

* ![icon](../media/Salg-solgt-detaljkort.bmp) : **Completed** status of an activity. A tick in the checkbox (![icon](../media/Utfoert.bmp)) means that the activity is completed, while an empty box means that it is not completed. For more information about how to change this status, see [Change Completed status of an activity](../diary/Marking-activities-as-completed-not-completed.md).

<!-- -->

* The second column contains icons that indicate the type of activity, one category for each of the different types. For example, a telephone icon indicates a phone call. These icons reflect the text in the **Type** column.
* <!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->
    [!include[Table showing icons for activities](../../includes/table-activity-icons.md)]
* The date of the activity.
* The type of activity.
* Any description of the activity.
* Any company and contact the activity is linked to.
* ID specifies which user owns the activity.
