# Section tabs in the Sale screen

The lower part of the **Sale** screen consists of section tabs which show [activities](activities-sale.md), a [sales guide](sales-guide.md), [stakeholders](StakeHolders.md) and [quotes](quote-detailcard.md) (requires a licence). Sales guides are only shown for specific sales types (defined in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance).
