# Section tabs in the Sale screen

The lower part of the **Sale** screen consists of section tabs which show [activities](activities-sale.md), a [sales guide](sales-guide.md), [stakeholders](StakeHolders.md) and [quotes](quote-detailcard.md) (requires a licence). Sales guides are only shown for specific sales types (defined in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance).

Additionally, you can define in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance (**Lists &gt; GUI - Web panel)** that more section tabs will be added in the form of URL addresses which SuperOffice CRM links to. You then open the URL address by clicking the tab itself. Here you can click **Open in separate window** to view the web page in a separate browser window.
