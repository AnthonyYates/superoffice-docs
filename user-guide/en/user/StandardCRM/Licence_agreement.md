# Licence agreement

Below you will find the licence agreement applying to SuperOffice products.

If you acquired your SuperOffice product in the UK or the Republic of Ireland, the following limited express warranty applies to you:

LIMITED RIGHTS: SuperOffice warrants that (a) the SOFTWARE PRODUCT will perform substantially in accordance with the accompanying written material(s) for a period of 90 days from the date of receipt; and (b) any Support Services provided by SuperOffice shall be substantially as described in applicable written materials provided to you by SuperOffice. SuperOffice's support engineers will make commercially reasonable efforts to solve any problem issues. Except where otherwise prohibited by legislation, SuperOffice's responsibility for the SOFTWARE PRODUCT referred to above is limited to ninety (90) days.

CUSTOMER REMEDIES: SuperOffice and its suppliers' full and sole responsibility and your only remedy will be, at SuperOffice's option, either a) return of the price paid or b) repair or replacement of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT that does not meet the above Limited Express Warranty and which is returned to SuperOffice together with a copy of your invoice. This Limited Express Warranty is void if failure of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT has resulted from accident, abuse, or misapplication. Any replacement SOFTWARE PRODUCT will be covered by the Limited Express Warranty for the remainder of the original warranty period or thirty (30) days, whichever is longer. Outside the United States, neither these remedies nor any product support services offered by SuperOffice are available without proof of purchase from an authorised source outside the USA.

NO OTHER LIABILITY: EXCEPT AS ENSUES FROM APPLICABLE BINDING LEGISLATION, SUPEROFFICE AND ITS SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL AND ANY OTHER LIABILITIES, WHETHER EXPLICIT OR IMPLICIT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLICIT LIABILITY FOR OR GUARANTEES OF SALEABILITY OR USABILITY FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES AND LIABILITY ENSUING FROM ANY INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS IN RESPECT OF THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT OR A LACK THEREOF. THESE LIMITED RIGHTS ARE SPECIFICALLY ACCORDED TO YOU BY SUPEROFFICE. OTHER RIGHTS MAY ENSUE FROM APPLICABLE LEGISLATION.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY: EXCEPT AS ENSUES FROM APPLICABLE BINDING LEGISLATION, NEITHER SUPEROFFICE NOR ITS SUPPLIERS ARE IN ANY EVENT LIABLE FOR ANY FORM OF SPECIAL, ACCIDENTAL OR INDIRECT LOSS OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PRODUCT LIABILITY, LOSS OF EARNINGS, INTERRUPTION OF OPERATIONS, LOSS OF INFORMATION IN THE BUSINESS OR OTHER FINANCIAL LOSS) ARISING FROM THE USE OR LACK OF ABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT OR FROM CUSTOMER SUPPORT OR A LACK THEREOF. THIS APPLIES EVEN IF SUPEROFFICE HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL FOR SUCH DAMAGES OR LOSS. IN ANY EVENT, SUPEROFFICE'S COMPLETE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE ACTUALLY PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT. IF YOU HAVE ENTERED INTO A SPECIAL AGREEMENT FOR CUSTOMER SUPPORT FROM SUPEROFFICE, THE PROVISIONS IN THIS AGREEMENT APPLY IN RESPECT OF SUPEROFFICE'S LIABILITY RELATING TO CUSTOMER SUPPORT. SINCE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT PERMIT THE WAIVING OR LIMITING OF LIABILITY, IT MAY BE THAT THE ABOVE-MENTIONED LIMITATION DOES NOT APPLY IN THE PARTICULAR CUSTOMER'S CASE.

This agreement is subject to Norwegian law and both parties recognise the City of Oslo Stipendiary Magistrate's Court as the legal venue.

CONSUMER PURCHASES - This agreement is subject to the limitations ensuing from the binding provisions on consumer purchases in the Norwegian Sale of Goods Act, see Act of 13 May 1988, no. 27 on The Sale of Goods, section 4.

Should you have any questions concerning this Licence Agreement, or wish to contact SuperOffice for any other reason, please write to the offices of SuperOffice's representatives in Norway or to SuperOffice AS, postboks 1884 Vika, N-0124 Oslo, Norway.
