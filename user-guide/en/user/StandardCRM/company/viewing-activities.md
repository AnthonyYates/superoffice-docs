# View activities

The activities displayed depend on which of the following checkboxes you have selected at the bottom of the section tab:

* Follow-ups
* Documents
* Mailings
* Other (chat records and form submissions)

You can show all activities, or just one of the types. For more details about the different activities, see [Activities in SuperOffice CRM](../diary/index.md).

> [!TIP]
> You can also filter activities by date and user (see [Use the Filter function](Using-Filter-function-Contact.md)).
