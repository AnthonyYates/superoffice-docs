# Generate personal data report

If a contact has requested to view all information registered on them in SuperOffice, you can go to the **Contact** screen and generate a report containing the personal data of a contact. The report contains all data registered on this contact in SuperOffice, including contact information, interests, subscriptions, consent information and registered activities and communication (follow-ups, documents, requests and mailings).

To generate a personal data report for a contact:

1. Go to the required contact in the **Contact** screen. (See [Use the Find screen](../key-functions/Find-dialog.md).)
2. Click **Task** ( ![icon][img1] ) &gt; **Generate personal data report**.
3. In the **Privacy report** dialog, you view the information registered on the contact.
4. Send the report as an e-mail attachment or save the report as a PDF.

The report is archived in the **Activities** section tab.
