# Delete contacts (Company screen)

Why would you delete contacts in SuperOffice? A contact may have been added by mistake or be a duplicate, or a contact has been added with only a first name etc.

There are three ways you can delete a contact from SuperOffice CRM:

* Delete a contact from the **Company** screen, as described below.
* Delete a contact from the **Contact** screen. See [Delete contacts (Contact screen)](../person/contact-delete.md).
* Bulk delete contacts at once. See [Bulk update](../key-functions/Bulk-update.md).

> [!TIP]
> Instead of deleting a contact, you can check **Former employee** in the contact card (see [Create new contacts](create-new-contacts.md)). Then this personâ€™s name will not disappear from activities, for example, to which he or she is linked.

To delete a contact:

1. Go to the required company in the **Company** screen. (See [Use the Find screen](../key-functions/Find-dialog.md).)
2. Select the **Contacts** section tab.
3. Select the required contact.

> [!NOTE]
> You can select and delete several contacts simultaneously.

1. Click the **Delete** button in the footer of the **Contacts** section tab. The **Delete Contact** dialog opens. You can also right-click the contact and select **Delete**.

<!-- -->

1. Click **Yes** to confirm that you really want to delete the contact. (For more details about this, see [Delete items in SuperOffice CRM](../key-functions/Deleting-elements-in-CRM.md).)
