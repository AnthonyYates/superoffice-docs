# Move contacts

[!include[Requirement](../../includes/note-req-manage-entities.md)]

You can move a contact from one company to another. If a contact has been set up under the wrong company, or if they have changed department, they can be moved, including their activities and memberships. You also have the option of disconnecting a contact from a company.

Proceed as follows to move a contact to another company:

1. In the **Company** screen: Go to the **Contacts** section tab, right-click the contact you want to move, select **Manage contacts** and **Move contact**.  
    In the **Contact** screen: Go to the required contact, click the **Task** button ( ![icon](../../../../media/icons/btn-menu.png) ) in the contact card, and select **Manage contacts** and **Move contact**.  
    This opens the **Move contact** dialog.
2. Under **Action on contact**, select one of the following options:
    * Select **Move to** and choose the company you want to move the contact to. Use [FastSearcher](../key-functions/Using-FastSearcher.md), [The History list](../key-functions/Using-history-list.md) or [Find](../key-functions/Find-dialog.md) ( ![icon](../../media/globalmenu-search.png) ).
    * Select **Disconnect from &lt;company&gt;**.
3. Select one of the following under **Action on all existing activities and sales**:
    * **Leave all on &lt;company&gt;**. Select this option if you do not want to transfer the activities and sales along with the contact, but keep them on the current company.
    * **Move all to...**. Select this option if you want to transfer all the activities and sales to the new company. If you are disconnecting a contact, all the activities and sales are transferred to the contact.
    * **Move all activities starting after**. Select this option if you want to transfer activities and sales starting after a specific date.
4. Select one of the following under **Action on all existing activities and sales**:
    * **Leave all on &lt;company&gt;**. Select this option if you do not want to transfer the activities and sales along with the contact, but keep them on the current company.
    * **Move all to...**. Select this option if you want to transfer all the activities and sales to the new company. If you are disconnecting a contact, all the activities and sales are transferred to the contact.
