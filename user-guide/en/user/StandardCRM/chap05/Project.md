# Project

Using the **Project** function, you can link any activities both to an external company and to the project. You can also work using a project guide that takes you through each step of the project, assuming a project guide has been created for the project type you have selected. A project can be targeted at many contacts, and a contact can participate in many projects.

In the **Project** screen, each project is displayed like an index card. You can see all the information that has been entered for a project.

To move backwards and forwards between projects, click the previous/next buttons ( ![icon](../media/Pil-venstre.bmp)![icon](../media/Pil-hoeyre.bmp) ) at the bottom right of the cards

## Add record as a favourite

To add a record to favourites, click the star icon ![icon](../../Service/media/favourite-inactive.png) in the corner of the relevant card, tab or dialog. The star turns yellow ![icon](../../Service/media/favourite-active.png), and the record is instantly added to favourites. You do not have to click **Save**.

Now you can quickly access the record by clicking ![icon](../../media/navmenu-favourites.png) from the Navigator menu. The favourites are also available in the side panel.

You can also:

* enter, edit and delete projects
* merge projects
* add project members
* link activities to a project
* link projects to a sale
* perform projects using a project guide

If you have selected a project type for which a project guide has been defined, the **Project guide** tab is displayed on the section tab. For more information, see [Project guide](Projectguide.md).
