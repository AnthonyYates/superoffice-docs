# Project guide section tab

When you create a project and select a project type for which a project guide has been defined, the **Project guide** section tab is displayed with the other section tabs underneath.

The buttons for the different statuses are displayed at the top of the section tab. The appearance of the buttons changes as you complete the statuses in the project guide:

| Button | Description |
|:-:|---|
| ![icon](../media/Chap08-project/chap8-projguide-completed-status.bmp) | Completed status |
| ![icon](../media/Chap08-project/chap8-projguide-current-status.bmp) | Current status |
| ![icon](../media/Chap08-project/chap8-projguide-future-status.bmp) | Future status |

Each status in the project guide contains different follow-ups and/or documents, which are shown in the lower half of the section tab. They are listed in two columns, **Follow-ups** and **Documents**. If you click the button for a status, the lower half of the section tab shows which activities belong to the status.

The ![icon](../media/Milestone-icon.bmp) icon is displayed in front of follow-ups defined as milestones. The definition is done in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance. The main card shows the date for the next milestone follow-up in the **Next milestone** field.

Click **Create** next to the follow-ups and documents to create them. You can also click the title of the follow-up or document to create it.

> [!TIP]
> All follow-ups and documents you have created for a project guide are also displayed on the **Activities** section tab in the **Project** screen. This provides you with an overview of all activities linked to the project - both completed and uncompleted activities.

Once a follow-up or document has been created, you can subsequently delete or edit it by right-clicking the title of the follow-up/document and selecting from the menu that appears. Equally, you can also create a new follow-up or a new document of the same type.
