# Project guide

Using the project guide, the company can simplify and structure project execution for its project managers. The project guide guides you through the different statuses of a predefined project process and contains suggestions for which follow-ups should be performed and which documents created within each status. It can also suggest the next step in the project and display the project's milestones.

The project guide is defined in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance. See the **SuperOffice Settings and maintenance help** for instructions.

You can preview documents and activities in the **Preview** view in the side panel.
