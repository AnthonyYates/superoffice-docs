# Add project members and stakeholders from section tabs

You can add project members and stakeholders from the contact lists in different section tabs, for example **Company** (**Contacts**), **Selection** (**Company/Contact**), **Sale** (**Stakeholders**) and **Project** (**Project Members**). Thus procedure below can also be performed from the **Result** tab in the [Find screen](../chap01/Find_dialog.md).

You do this as follows:

1. Go to the required section tab or the **Find** screen.

2. Select the required contact on the list.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you want to add several contacts as stakeholders/project members, use **Shift** or **Ctrl** + click.

3. Right-click the contacts and select **Add to sale** or **Add to project** on the menu which appears.

4. In the **Sale** or **Project** field, specify to which sale/project the contacts will be added. Do this either by clicking the arrow and selecting the required sale/project in the displayed list box, or by typing in the whole or the beginning of the sale/project name.

5. In the **Sales role** or **Function** field, specify the sales role/function each person has in the sale/project. Click the arrow to display a list of predefined alternatives to choose from. These are defined in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.

6. Click **Save**. The contacts are added to the sale/project you have specified.
