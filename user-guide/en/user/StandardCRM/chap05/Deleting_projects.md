# Delete projects

To delete a whole project and associated data:

1. Go to the required project. (See [Use the Find screen](../chap01/Find_dialog.md).)
2. Click the **Task** button (![icon](../../media/btn_Menu.png)).
3. Select **Delete 'project name'**.
4. When you are asked if you really want to delete the project, click **Yes**. (For more details about this, see [Delete items in SuperOffice CRM](../chap01/Deleting_elements_in_CRM.md).)
