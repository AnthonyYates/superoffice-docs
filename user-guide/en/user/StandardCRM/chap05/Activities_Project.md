# Activities

![icon](../media/Chap08_project/90_chap8_activities.bmp)

The **Activities** section tab shows all activities that are linked to the active project, i.e. follow-ups (appointments, tasks and phone calls) and documents (including merge documents, reports and e-mail).

Double-click an activity in the section tab to view or edit it, as required.

> [!NOTE]
> Activities are described in more detail under [Activities in SuperOffice CRM](../chap02/Activities_in_SuperOffice_CRM.md).

### Columns in the Activities section tab

**Completed status** ![icon](../media/Salg_solgt_detaljkort.bmp)

The first column in the **Activities** section tab indicates the **Completed** status of an activity. A tick in the checkbox (![icon](../media/Utfoert.bmp)) means that the activity is completed, while an empty box means that it is not completed. For more details on the **Completed** status, see [Change Completed status of an activity](../chap02/Marking_activities_as_completed_not_completed.md).

Type icons

The second column contains icons that indicate the type of activity, for example, a clock for an appointment and a telephone for a call. These icons reflect the text in the **Type** column.
