# Section tabs in the Project screen

The bottom part of the **Project** screen consists of section tabs which display a project guide (if one is defined for the current project type), project members, activities and sales that are linked to each individual project. The section tabs are described below.

Additionally, you can define in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance (**Lists &gt; GUI - Web panel)** that more section tabs will be added in the form of URL addresses which SuperOffice CRM links to. You then open the URL address by clicking the tab itself. Here you can click **Open in separate window** to view the web page in a separate browser window.
