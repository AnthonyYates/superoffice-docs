# Add links from the Project screen

You can add links to activities or websites that are relevant to the project. For example, if you are going to a meeting with a company you have previously communicated with, you can add links to documents and sales you have already created for this company.

1. Click the **Links** tab.
2. Click **Edit** to switch to edit mode.
3. Click **Add**. The **Add link** dialog opens.
4. Select the link type you want to add. The options are **URL**, **Project**, **Sale**, **Document** and **Follow-up**.
5. In the next field, select what you want to create a link to. Use the [history list](../chap01/Using_the_history_list.md) or start typing to search. The name of this field changes according to the link type you selected above. If, for example, you selected **URL** in the **Type** field, here you enter the **URL** address of the page you want to display.
6. Enter a brief description of the link in the **Description** field. If you enter a description, this will be used as the link text.
7. Click **OK** to save the link.
8. Click **Save** in the **Links** tab.

A dot on the **Link** tab header indicates that a link has been added to the sale.

## Open links

You can open links by clicking on them in the **Links** tab. URLs/websites open in a new window.

## Remove links

If you want to remove a link, go to the **Links** tab, click **Edit**, click the delete button next to the link. The link will be deleted from the tab.
