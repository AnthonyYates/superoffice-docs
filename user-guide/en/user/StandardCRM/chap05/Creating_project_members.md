# Add project members

To link the project to a company, you must specify at least one project member, as follows:

1. Go to the required project in the **Project** screen. (See [Use the Find screen](../chap01/Find_dialog.md).)

2. Choose the **Project Members** section tab.

3. Click the **Add** button below the section tab. The **Add project members** dialog opens.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also add project members via the section tabs containing contacts in the **Company**, **Selection** and **Sale** screens. See [Add project members and stakeholders from section tabs](Adding_project_members.md) for more information.

4. In the **Company/contact** field:
    * To select a contact from a company: Click the arrow and select the company you want in the list that appears, or type the name of the company. By default the company that is active in the **Company** screen is shown.
    * To select a contact directly: Type the name of the contact (this applies to both contacts with and without an associated company), and click the name in the results list.

5. In the **Project** field specify which project to add the project member(s) to. You can do this by clicking the arrow and selecting the required project in the list box which appears.

6. In the list of contacts on the left select the contact(s) you want to add to the project.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the required name is not in the list, you must first create the contact. For more details, see [Create new contacts](../person/contact_create_contacts.md).

7. Click the arrow button to the right of the list ( ![icon](../media/Pil_hoeyre.bmp) ). The contact(s) will then be displayed on the right of the dialog.

8. In the **Function** field, specify the function each person has in the project. Click the arrow to display a list of predefined alternatives to choose from. These are defined in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.

9. In the large text box under **Comment**, enter a more detailed description of the personâ€™s function within the project, if required.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you enter anything in this text box, a paperclip symbol ( ![icon](../media/Binders.bmp) ) will be displayed in the **Project member information** column in the **Project Members** section tab. Position the mouse pointer over the paperclip to display a tooltip containing the comment.

10. When you have entered the required information, click **OK**.

> [!TIP]
> You can select multiple contacts on the right side of the window by holding down **CTRL** or **SHIFT** as you select. Changes you then make in the **Function** field and **Comment** text box will apply to all the selected contacts.
