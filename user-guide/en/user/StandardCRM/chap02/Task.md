# Task

Tasks are follow-ups which do not usually have a defined time or duration. They always have a date deadline â€“ for example, they may be things you have to remember to do by a certain time.

<table>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><p>![icon](../media/Knapperad_Oppgave.bmp)</p></td>
<td><p>No matter where you are in SuperOffice CRM, you can create a new task by clicking **New** &gt; **Task** on the top bar.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Tasks can be displayed in the following places in SuperOffice CRM:

* on the **Activities** section tab in the **Company** screen.
* on the **Activities** section tab in the **Contact** screen.
* on the **Activities** section tab in the **Sale** screen.
* on the **Activities** section tab in the **Project** screen.
* on the **Activities** section tab in the **Diary** screen.

> [!NOTE]
> If you specify a start and end time for a task, it will be entered in the diary at the correct day and time.

The [Create tasks](Creating_tasks.md) topic describes how to create a task. Other aspects of tasks are explained in general under [Activities in SuperOffice CRM](Activities_in_SuperOffice_CRM.md) and [Work with follow-ups](Follow-ups_in_SuperOffice_CRM.md).
