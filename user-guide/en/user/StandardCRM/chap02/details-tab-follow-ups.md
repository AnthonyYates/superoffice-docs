# The Details tab (follow-ups)

The **Details** tab contains detailed information about the follow-up.

**Recurrence**

In this field, you indicate whether the follow-up is a repeating one. Click the word **Never** to the right of the **Recurrence** field if you want the appointment to be repeated at regular intervals. See [Create repeating follow-ups](Creating_recurring_follow-ups.md) for more information. If a follow-up has been specified as repeating, an icon ( ![icon](../media/Recurring_booking_assignment.bmp) ) at the upper left of the main part of the dialog.

**Priority**

Specify here the priority of the follow-up. Click the arrow to display a list with the default options of high, medium and low priority. These are defined in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.

**Alarm**

For notification of the follow-up, check **Alarm**.For more information about this, see [Set alarms for follow-ups](Setting_an_alarm_for_follow-ups.md). If an alarm has been specified for a follow-up, an icon ( ![icon](../media/followup_details_alarm.bmp) ) is displayed at the upper left of the main part of the dialog.

Owner

Here you specify who owns the follow-up. The default is the user currently logged in. If you click the name next to the **Owner** field, you can transfer the appointment to another SuperOffice user. The **Assign to** dialog opens. Under the **Assign this follow-up to** field is a list box where you can select the required user group. Select the required user and click **OK** to save the changes and close the dialog.

> [!NOTE]
> If a user is already occupied at the time in question, the word **CONFLICT** is displayed in the **Status** field. If you want to hide users with conflicts, check **Hide conflict** at the bottom of the dialog.

Show as

Check **Free** or **Busy** in the **Show as** field to specify whether you are available to others while the appointment is taking place. If you select **Free**, you can have other follow-ups simultaneously, for example if you have reserved the majority of the day to work on a project but you still have time for short meetings.

Visible for

Click the **Visible for** field to display a list that allows you to choose whether the follow-up will be visible to all users, visible only to the user defined as owner, or visible to all users in one of the user groups that the owner belongs to.

> [!NOTE]
> If you specify that an entry will only be visible to the owner, it will appear in italics on the **Activities** section tab.

This option is only available if **Confidential activities** is enabled for the current user in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.

Publish (requires separate licence)

Check here if you want the follow-up to be visible to external users.
