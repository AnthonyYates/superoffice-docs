# Send documents

## Send a document as e-mail

1. Go to the **New e-mail** dialog in one of the following ways:
    * <!-- Fix reuse ID=a3 -->
        1. Select one or more documents on the **Activities** section tab in the **Company**, **Contact**, **Diary**, **Sale** or **Project** screens.
        2. Right-click and select **Send as e-mail**.
    * <!-- Fix reuse ID=a2 -->
        1. Open the document in **Edit** mode.
        2. Click the **Task** button.
        3. Select **Send as e-mail**.

        > [!NOTE]
        > You can only send one document at a time in this fashion. If you want to send several documents at once, select the documents in the **Activities** section tab.

    <!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->
    If the dialog is displayed, do as follows:

    1. Choose the company to send the document to in the company field. By default the company that is active in the **Company** screen is shown. Here you can also use [FastSearcher](../chap01/Using-FastSearcher.md) or [The History list](../chap01/Using-the-history-list.md). Once you have chosen a company, their e-mail address is displayed next to the company field.
    2. To send it to a specific person in the company, choose from the available alternatives in the list box for contacts. Once you have chosen a contact, their e-mail address is displayed next to the list box for contacts.
    3. Under **Selected e-mail address** there is now displayed the e-mail address or correctly-formatted fax number for the selected company (or contact if you have specified one). To send to a different e-mail address or fax number, enter that here.
    4. Click **Next** to send the document.
2. An empty message opens up in the **New e-mail** dialog:
    * The e-mail address of the addressee of the document is displayed by default in the **To** field.
    * The document heading is displayed in the **Subject** field of the e-mail.
    * The document itself is attached to the message as an ordinary e-mail attachment.
    * Type in a message to the recipient if required. If you want to, you can also change the recipient. Note, however, that this information will not be updated in SuperOffice CRM.
3. Click **Send** to send the message.
