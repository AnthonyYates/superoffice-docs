# The Participants tab (follow-ups)

This tab contains a list of participants in the follow-up. If any participants are registered, this is indicated with a dot on the actual **Participants** tab. For more details about follow-ups with several participants, see [Invite your associates to a follow-up](Creating_follow-ups_with_your_associates.md).

If you click the **View as group** button ( ![icon](../media/Vis_som_gruppe.bmp) ) at the bottom right of the **Participants** tab, the **View** tab in the diary opens, giving you an overview of the diaries of the invited associates (SuperOffice users). For more information about viewing other users' diaries, see [View another diary](../chap06/Viewing_another_diary.md).
