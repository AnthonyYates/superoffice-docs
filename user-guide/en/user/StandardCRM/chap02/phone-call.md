# Phone Call

Calls are follow-ups with a default duration of 15 minutes. The default start time is the current time and the date is todayâ€™s date. You can set up a call follow-up if, for example, you want to enter an outgoing phone call.

> [!TIP]
> You can change the default duration to something other than 15 minutes. Select ![icon](../media/globalmenu-personalsettings-small.png)**Personal settings &gt; Preferences** &gt; **Default values** &gt; **Duration of a new phone call** and enter the required value as described under [Preferences](../chap01/Preferences.md).
