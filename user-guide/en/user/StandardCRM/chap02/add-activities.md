# Add follow-ups (appointments, tasks and phone calls)

To create follow-ups in SuperOffice CRM, you can click the **New** button on the top bar.

> [!TIP]
> You can also add follow-ups by double-clicking an empty line in the **Activities** section tab. By default this opens the **Appointment** dialog. You can specify which dialog should open under **Preferences** (![icon](../media/globalmenu_personalsettings_small.png)**Personal settings &gt; Preferences &gt; Functions &gt; Type from Activities section tab**).
