# Compose an e-mail

<table>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><p>![icon](../media/Knapperad_E-post.bmp)</p></td>
<td><p>No matter where you are in SuperOffice CRM, you can compose a new e-mail message by clicking the **New** button in the top bar.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

A simple way to create an e-mail message:

1. Select **New &gt; E-mail**. The **Mail** dialog opens.

1. Click in the **To** field, and start typing the name of the contact you want to send the message to.

2. Select a contact in the list of results. You can also click ![icon](../media/navigator_history_small.png) to select a recent contact.

3. Repeat step 2 and 3 to add additional recipients.

4. Optional: Click **Cc/Bcc** to send copies or blind copies to other recipients.

5. In the **Subject** field, enter a brief description of what the message is about.

6. Click the message field and type in your message.

7. To include an attachment in the message, click ![icon](../media/web_email_add_attachment_SMALL.bmp) at the bottom of the window. In the **Attachment** section that displays at the top of the window, you have the following options:

    * Click **Upload files (or drag here)** to browse to and add a file from a disk or server.
    * Drag and drop a file from Windows Explorer to the **Attachment** section.
    * Click **Select a CRM document** to select a document in SuperOffice CRM.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you want to save the message temporarily and complete it later, click ![icon](../chap07web/media/window_close.png) in the top-right corner. The message will then be saved in the drafts folder.

8. To include an FAQ, a reply template or a quick reply in the e-mail message, click ![icon](../../Chat/media/chat_btn_FAQ.png) at the bottom of the window. <!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->.
    Select one of the following options and browse the folders. You can also enter search text in the top field, or click the relevant icons to access history and favourites.

    * **FAQ**: Inserts a link to an FAQ in SuperOffice Customer Centre. Only FAQs that are accessible to everyone and that are published, are available here.
    * **Reply templates**: Inserts the template text.
    * **Quick replies**: Inserts a <!-- Fix reuse ID=a2 -->(A quick reply is a pre-defined text that you can use in an e-mail message. It is similar to reply templates, but it is much easier and faster to create a quick reply. The quick replies you create will only be available to you.).

    To create quick replies:

    1. Click ![icon](../../Chat/media/chat_btn_edit.png) **Edit**. The **Quick replies** windows opens.
    2. Click **Add**. A new reply is added to the list.
    3. Click the **New name** field and enter a title for the quick reply. This will not be visible to the customer.
    4. Click the **New content** field and enter the reply text you want to send to customers.
    5. Click **Save**. The window closes and the new quick reply is saved.

When you have finished the message, and want to send it, you have the following options:

* To send the message straightaway, click the **Send** button.
* To send the message and archive it as a document in SuperOffice CRM, click **Send and archive**. The **Document** dialog opens. See [Create new documents](Creating_new_documents.md).

> [!TIP]
> If you do not archive the message when you send it, you can still go to the sent folder and archive the message as described in [Archive incoming e-mail](../chap07web/archive_buttons.md).

> [!TIP]
> The signature template at the bottom of the message can be edited in ![icon](../media/globalmenu_personalsettings_small.png)**Personal settings** &gt; **Edit personal signature**.
