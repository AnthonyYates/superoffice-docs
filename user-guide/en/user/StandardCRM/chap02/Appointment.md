# Appointment

Appointments are activities with a defined start and end time, such as meetings. The default duration for an appointment is 1 hour, but you can of course change the duration as required.

> [!TIP]
> This is done in the **Preferences** dialog, which you open by choosing **Preferences** on the **Personal settings** menu. Select **Default values**, and enter the required value under **Duration for new appointment** as described under [Preferences](../chap01/Preferences.md).

</tr>

Appointments can be displayed in the following places in SuperOffice CRM:

* on the **Activities** section tab in the **Company** screen.
* on the **Activities** section tab in the **Contact** screen.
* on the **Activities** section tab in the **Sale** screen.

* on the **Day**/**Week**/**Month**/**View** tabs in the **Diary** screen.
* in these side panel views: **Day**, **Month**, **Next day** and **Week**.

The [Create appointments](Creating_appointments.md) topic describes how to create an appointment. Other aspects of appointments are explained in general under [Activities in SuperOffice CRM](Activities_in_SuperOffice_CRM.md) and [Work with follow-ups](Follow-ups_in_SuperOffice_CRM.md).
