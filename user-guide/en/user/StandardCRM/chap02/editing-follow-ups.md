# Edit follow-ups

2. Make the required changes in the dialog (see [The Dialog for follow-ups](Dialog_for_followups.md)).
3. Click **Save** to save the information and close the dialog.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot edit completed follow-ups until you have undone their **Completed** status. See [Change Completed status of an activity](Marking_activities_as_completed_not_completed.md).
