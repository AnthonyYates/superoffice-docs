# The Dialog for follow-ups

Regardless of the type of follow-up you are working with, you will see the dialog for follow-ups. The actual name of this dialog varies according to the type of follow-up – **Appointment** (see [Appointment](Appointment.md)), **Task** (see [Task](Task.md)) or **Phone Call** (see [Phone Call](Phone-call.md)) – but the fields are the same in each case. The fields in the dialog and how to use them are described below.

The dialog consists of a main section with general information about the follow-up, and five tabs with additional information.

* [Description](Description-tab-follow-ups.md)
* [Details](Details-tab-follow-ups.md)
* [Participants](Participants-category.md)
* [Links](Links-tab-follow-ups.md)
* [More](More-tab-follow-ups.md)

The main section contains the following essential information about the follow-up:

**\[Type\]**

Click the arrow next to this field ( ![icon](../media/Dialogboksknapper-pil-ned.bmp) ) to display a predefined list of follow-up types to choose from, for example, a meeting or outgoing phone call. You can also search for types by typing into this field. Here you can also use [FastSearcher](../chap01/Using-FastSearcher.md).

> [!NOTE]
> It is the **\[Type\]** field which determines the type of follow-up in question, i.e. an appointment, task or phone call.

\[Video meeting\]

Click ![icon](../media/videomeeting-inactive.png) to set up a video meeting. The icon changes to ![icon](../media/videomeeting-active.png). See [Set up video meetings](video-meetings.md).

\[Company\]

Enter here the name of the company linked to the follow-up (optional). If you cannot remember the whole name, you can search directly from this field.

\[Contact\]

Click the arrow next to this field and a list of known contacts in the company is displayed. If no company has been selected, you will see a list of contacts that are not associated with a company. You can search directly from this field.

Project

Enter the name of the project that the follow-up is linked to. If you cannot remember the whole name, you can search directly from this field.

> [!NOTE]
> In the **Project** field, you can specify any of the projects which are saved in SuperOffice CRM, regardless of which company the follow-up is linked to.

Sale

Here you enter the name of the sale, if any, that the follow-up is linked to. If you cannot remember the whole name, you can search directly from this field.

\[Time zone selector\]

If time zones have been activated in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance, you can select which time zone the follow-up will be created in. The time zones are displayed by country, and you can search both by country and city directly in the time zone field (see [Time zones](../chap06/Time-zones.md)).

Start / End/Due / Duration

Enter a date and, where appropriate, a time in the **Start** field and the **End** field (for appointments and phone calls) or **Due** field (for tasks), for the follow-up start and the follow-up end/deadline respectively. If you specify a time, the content of the **Duration** field is automatically adjusted accordingly.

> [!TIP]
> If the follow-up conflicts with another one or has several participants, the **First available** field is displayed, showing the first available meeting time.

All day

If you check **All day**, the time of the appointment is set to the period specified as the default working day.

> [!TIP]
> These default values are specified in the [Preferences](../chap01/Preferences.md) dialog. Select **Diary**, and enter the required times for **All-day start time** and **All-day end time**.

Location

Here you choose the address where the follow-up will take place. By default, this field is empty, but if you click the arrow ( ![icon](../media/Dialogboksknapper-pil-ned.bmp) ) next to the field, two entries are displayed in a list box. One is the user's company and the other is the company that is to be followed up. If you have specified a resource of type **Location** as a participant in the **Participants** tab, e.g. a meeting room, the resource is also displayed in this list box.

> [!TIP]
> You can also simply enter an address for the location.

Completed ![icon](../media/followup-notcompleted.png) ![icon](../media/followup-completed.png)

Check here when the follow-up is completed. For more information, see [Mark activities as completed/not completed](Marking-activities-as-completed-not-completed.md).

Task ![icon](../../media/btn-Menu.png)

Click this button to access relevant tasks that can be performed on the active entry. Examples: Delete, Print, Send as e-mail, Assign to and Cancel meeting. In SuperOffice Settings and maintenance, you can also define your own tasks and add them under the **Task** button. For more information about this, see the Help for SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.

**Registered/Last modified**

These fields show the date when the follow-up was first created and when it was last modified. They also show who completed these actions.

> [!TIP]
> If you hold the mouse pointer over this text, a tooltip appears containing more information about when the follow-up was created and last modified.
