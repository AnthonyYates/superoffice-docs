# Assign a follow-up to someone else

If you are creating a follow-up on behalf of someone else, you can change the owner of the follow-up (that is, assign the follow-up to someone else).

Examples: Your colleague is on vacation, but he needs to phone a client when he gets back. You have arranged a meeting with a client, but you need to delegate it to someone else.

## Assign a follow-up to someone else

1. Open or create a follow-up. See [Add follow-ups (appointments, tasks and phone calls)](Add-activities.md).
2. Select the **Details** tab and click the name in the **Owner** field.  
    or  
    Click the **Task** button ( ![icon](../../media/btn-Menu.png) ) and select **Assign to**.  
    The **Assign to** dialog opens.
3. Click the list at the top to select which users to display (history list, all or groups).
4. Select a person from the list. A conflict icon indicates if a person has another follow-up at the given time.
5. Click **OK** and **Save**.

The selected person is now the owner of the follow-up, and will see the follow-up in their diary and activities list.
