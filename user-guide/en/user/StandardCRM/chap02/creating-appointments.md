# Create appointments

To create a new appointment from anywhere in SuperOffice CRM:

* Choose **New** &gt; **Appointment** on the [top bar](../chap01/Buttons-in-the-menu-bar.md).
* Click the **Task** button ( ![icon][img1]) ) in the contact card, and select **Request a meeting**.
* Click the **Add** button in the **Activities** section tab.

From the **Diary** screen, create a new appointment as follows:

* Click the **Add** button on the section tabs.
* Drag and drop using the mouse (see [Create follow-ups from the Diary](../chap06/Creating-appointments-using-the-Diary.md)).

Regardless of which method you use, the **Appointment** dialog opens and this is where you specify the appointment details as described under [The Dialog for follow-ups](Dialog-for-followups.md).
