# Invite your associates to a follow-up

To allocate time for a meeting with one or more associates, use the **View** tab in the **Diary** screen. Here you can open your associates' diaries to see when your colleagues are available for a meeting. (See [Create group views](../chap06/Creating-diary-views.md).) In addition, you can select to view resources such as conference rooms, to see when they are free and set up a joint reservation for everyone from within your own diary.

Follow-ups with associates are set up by linking them as participants to the follow-up. See [Add participants to follow-ups](Linking-participants-to-follow-ups.md).
