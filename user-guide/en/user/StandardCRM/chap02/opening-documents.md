# Open documents

You can open and view exiting documents from the following locations:

* The **Activities** section tab in the **Company** screen
* The **Activities** section tab in the **Contact** screen
* The **Activities** section tab in the **Sale** screen
* The **Activities** section tab in the **Project** screen
* The **Activities** section tab in the **Diary** screen
* The **Documents** section tab in the **Selection** screen, if a document selection is active.
* The search results in the **Document** tab in the **Find** screen.

You can open a document in edit mode or in read mode. When you open the document in edit mode, only you can edit the document. Other users can open the document in read mode. See [Check in/out documents](doc_checkoutin.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If your organisation uses a document library like SharePoint, multiple people can edit a document simultaneously.

The document is opened in the program it was created in.

The procedure depends on how documents are managed in your SuperOffice installation. See [Edit documents](Editing_documents.md).

## Add record as a favourite

To add a record to favourites, click the star icon ![icon](../../Service/media/favourite_inactive.png) in the corner of the relevant card, tab or dialog. The star turns yellow ![icon](../../Service/media/favourite_active.png), and the record is instantly added to favourites. You do not have to click **Save**.

Now you can quickly access the record by clicking ![icon](../../media/navmenu_favourites.png) from the Navigator menu. The favourites are also available in the side panel.
