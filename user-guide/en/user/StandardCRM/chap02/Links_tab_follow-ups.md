# The Links tab (follow-ups)

This tab contains information about URLs, activities (documents and follow-ups), projects and sales that are linked to the follow-up in question. If anything is registered in this tab, a dot is displayed next to **Links**. For more information on how to add links, see [Add links from the dialog for follow-ups or the Document dialog](Linking_documents_to_follow-ups.md).
