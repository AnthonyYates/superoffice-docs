# Activities in SuperOffice CRM

![icon](../media/Chap04_activities/30_chap4_activities-detail.bmp)

The **Activities** section tab is available in the **Company** screen, the **Contact** screen, the **Project** screen, the **Diary** screen and the **Sale** screen. You create activities using the ![icon](../media/globalmenu_new.png)**New** menu in the top bar, or by double-clicking in the section tab.

* The **Activities** section tab in the **Company** screen displays activities linked to the company in question. See [Activities (Company)](../chap03/Activities_Contact.md).

* The **Activities** section tab in the **Contact** screen displays activities linked to the contact in question. See [Activities (Contact)](../person/contact_secttab_activities.md).

* The **Activities** section tab in the **Project** and **Sale** screens displays activities linked to the project or sale in question. See [Activities (Project)](../chap05/Activities_Project.md) and [Activities section tab (Sale)](../sale/activities_sale.md).

* The **Activities** section tab in the **Diary** screen displays all your uncompleted activities. See [Activities section tab (Diary)](../chap06/activities_list.md).

* Activities are also displayed in the different views in the **Diary** screen. See [Tabs in the Diary screen](../chap06/Tabs_in_the_Diary_screen.md).

There are two types of activities â€“ documents and follow-ups. Follow-ups is a collective term for appointments, phone calls and tasks. In addition, mailings, form submissions and chat records are displayed in the **Activities** section tab.

The table below illustrates the different kinds of activities:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><p><strong>Activities</strong></p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p><strong>Follow-ups</strong></p></td>
<td><p><strong>Documents</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Mailings / Form submissions</p></td>
<td><p>Chat sessions</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Appointment</p></td>
<td><p>Task</p></td>
<td><p>Phone Call</p></td>
<td><p>Document</p></td>
<td><p>E-mail</p></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>![icon](../media/Knapperad_Avtale.bmp)</p></td>
<td><p>![icon](../media/Knapperad_Oppgave.bmp)</p></td>
<td><p>![icon](../media/Knapperad_Samtale.bmp)</p></td>
<td><p>![icon](../media/Knapperad_Skriv.bmp)</p></td>
<td><p>![icon](../media/Knapperad_E-post.bmp)</p></td>
<td><p>![icon](../media/Knapperad_Mailings.bmp) ![icon](../media/Knapperad_Forms.bmp)</p></td>
<td><p>![icon](../media/Knapperad_Chat.bmp)</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The activities list columns contain the following information:

* ![icon](../media/Utfoert.bmp): The first column in the activities list specifies the **Completed** status of an activity. A tick means that the activity is completed, while an empty box means that it is not completed.
* The Category column contains icons that indicate the type of activity, for example, a telephone for a call. These icons reflect the text in the **Type** column.
* The other columns in the activities list show various information about the activity. If not all the text in a field is visible, hold the mouse pointer over it to display it in a tooltip.

The activities displayed depend on which of the following checkboxes you have selected at the bottom of the section tab:

* Follow-ups (appointments, tasks and phone calls)
* Documents (e-mail, letters, and other documents)
* Mailings (bulk mailings by merged document, e-mail or SMS)
* Other (chat records, form submissions)

You can show all activities, or just one type.

Each type of activity will be dealt with in separate topics and chapters, as follows:

* [Appointment](Appointment.md)
* [Task](Task.md)
* [Phone Call](Phone_call.md)
* [Work with documents](Write.md)
* [Compose an e-mail](Compose_an_e-mail_(Web).md)
* [Chat](../../Chat/Chat.md)
