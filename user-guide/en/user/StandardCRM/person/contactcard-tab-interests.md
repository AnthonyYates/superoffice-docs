# The Interests tab (Contact screen)

In the **Interests** tab you have the following options:

## Interests

Here you select what interests a contact has. Interests are used to create selections for mailings and similar. The available interests are defined in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.

> [!TIP]
>  Interests can be useful for defining selections. If, for example, you have defined *reference account* as an interest, you can create a selection that contains all your reference accounts. This makes it easy to produce a marketing campaign aimed at this customer group.

## E-marketing/subscriptions

If the contact has agreed (given consent) to receive e-marketing (mailings), you can click **E-marketing**. By activating the **E-marketing** option for a contact, you also set the legal basis for the **E-marketing** purpose. It is changed to **Legitimate interest**.

You can also specify which types of e-marketing they should receive (also called subscription types). These settings may have been adjusted by the customers themselves via a customer portal.
