# Sales

The **Sales** section tab shows sales connected to the contact.

The following information is displayed in the columns on the **Sales** section tab:

* ![icon](../media/Utfoert.bmp): a checkbox showing whether the sale has been completed
* a status icon for the sale (specifies the saleâ€™s status, e.g. sold or lost)
* sale date
* an amount
* the sales stage
* the date of the next sales activity
* the name of the sale
* any contact the sale is linked to
* the company the sale is linked to
* the user ID of the person who recorded the sale
* ERP discount (if SuperOffice is linked to an ERP system)

**Tip:** You can configure the columns on the section tab to display just the information that interests you. See [Configure columns](../chap01/Changing_the_column_view.md). .

Double-click a sale in the list to open the **Sale** screen in SuperOffice CRM which contains information about that sale.

Click **Add** to create a new sale. For more details on how to manage sales, see [Sale](../sale/sale.md).

Click the **Filter** button ( ![icon](../media/Filter.bmp) ) to filter the list by date, users or groups. See [Filter sales](../chap03/Using_the_Filter_function_Contact.md).

If you check **Include stakeholders** at the bottom of the section tab, sales where the contact is involved as a stakeholder are also displayed. See [Stakeholders](../sale/StakeHolders.md).
