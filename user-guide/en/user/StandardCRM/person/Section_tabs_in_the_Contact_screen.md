# Section tabs in the Contact screen

The **Contact** screen contains the following section tabs with information linked to the current contact:

[Activities](contact_secttab_activities.md): The **Activities** section tab contains all the activities linked to the contact.

[Sales](contact_secttab_sales.md): The **Sales** section tab contains information about any sales connected to the contact.

[Requests](contact_secttab_requests.md): The **Requests** section tab shows SuperOffice Service requests for the contact.

[Projects](contact_secttab_projects.md): The **Projects** section tab shows all the projects where the active contact is a project member.

[Relations](contact_secttab_relations.md): The **Relations** section tab displays any connections existing between the current contact and other contacts or companies.

Additionally, you can define in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance (**Lists &gt; GUI - Web panel)** that more section tabs will be added in the form of URL addresses which SuperOffice CRM links to. You then open the URL address by clicking the tab itself. Here you can click **Open in separate window** to view the web page in a separate browser window.
