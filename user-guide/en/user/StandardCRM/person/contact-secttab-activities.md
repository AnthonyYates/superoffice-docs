# Activities (Contact screen)

The **Activities** section tab in the **Contact** screen contains all the activities linked to the active contact (including appointments where the contact is a participant).

If the contact is associated with a company, these activities will also be available in the **Activities** section tab in the **Company** screen.

## Filter activities

The activities displayed depend on which checkboxes you have selected at the bottom of the section tab. See [Use filters in the section tabs](../key-functions/Use-filters-in-the-section-tabs.md).

## Reply to or forward e-mails

E-mail messages that are saved as documents for a specific contact are displayed on the **Activities** section tab for that contact. To reply to or forward an e-mail, right-click the e-mail and choose **Reply** or **Forward**.
