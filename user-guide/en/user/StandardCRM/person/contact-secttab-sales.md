# Sales

The **Sales** section tab shows sales connected to the contact.

[!include[Contents of the Sales section tab](../../includes/sales-tab.md)]

> [!TIP]
>  You can configure the columns on the section tab to display just the information that interests you. See [Configure columns](../chap01/Changing-the-column-view.md). .

Double-click a sale in the list to open the **Sale** screen in SuperOffice CRM which contains information about that sale.

Click **Add** to create a new sale. For more details on how to manage sales, see [Sale](../sale/sale.md).

Click the **Filter** button ( ![icon](../media/Filter.bmp) ) to filter the list by date, users or groups. See [Filter sales](../chap03/Using-the-Filter-function-Contact.md).

If you check **Include stakeholders** at the bottom of the section tab, sales where the contact is involved as a stakeholder are also displayed. See [Stakeholders](../sale/StakeHolders.md).
