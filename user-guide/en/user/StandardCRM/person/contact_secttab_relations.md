# Relations (Contact screen)

The **Relations** section tab displays any connections existing between the current contact and other contacts or companies. Example: information about ownership structure or about people who have been employed in different companies.

The columns of the **Relations** section tab contain the following information:

* Names of contacts and companies that are part of a relation with the current contact.
* What relation they have to each other.
* Who created the relation.
* If a paperclip symbol ( ![icon](../media/Binders.bmp) ) is displayed, this indicates that there is a more detailed description of the relation in the **Relation** dialog. Hold the mouse-pointer over the paper-clip icon ( ![icon](../media/Binders.bmp) ) to display the description.

Double-click on a relation row and the **Relation** dialog opens, showing all the information entered for that relation (see [Add relations](contact_secttab_relations_add.md)).
