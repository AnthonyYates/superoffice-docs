# View another diary

The diary in SuperOffice CRM is fundamentally a personal diary. Your name is displayed at the top right of the **Diary** screen.

However, you can also open another userâ€™s diary, or the diary of an available resource, to see when they are free, for example, or to create follow-ups for them directly.

To open another diary:

1. Click your name in any tab in the **Diary** screen. A list box is displayed containing other resources, user groups and users who are connected to the network. This is called the *diary owner list*.

    > [!TIP]
    > Using FastSearcher, you can search for users by name or user ID.

2. Select a resource or user directly, or click a user group ( ![icon](../media/Dialogboksknapper-pil-hoeyre.bmp) ). You can then select from a list of all people linked to this group of SuperOffice CRM users.

3. The diary of the other user or resource opens and their name is displayed in place of your own at the top right of the **Diary** screen. The activities list of the other user or resource is also displayed.

> [!NOTE]
> Other users are displayed with the ![icon](../media/dagbokeierliste-annen-person.bmp) icon and red underlining, while resources are displayed with the ![icon](../media/dagbokeierliste-annen-ressurs.bmp) icon and blue underlining.

When you open the diary of another user or resource, you can switch between the different tabs as in your own diary, and you can create follow-ups in their diaries by clicking and selecting time periods with the mouse, provided that you have the access rights to do so. (See [Create follow-ups from the Diary](Creating-appointments-using-the-Diary.md)).

You can also see an overview for several users and resources at the same time by using the **Show** button at the bottom of the **View** tab.
