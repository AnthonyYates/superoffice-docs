# Move between activities in the activities list

Use the scroll arrows on the right-hand side to scroll up and down in the activities list.

To view the details of several activities from the activities list, without having to open each individual activity:

1. Go to the side panel and select the **Preview** view.
2. Click an activity in the activities list. The side panel displays a preview of the selected activity.
