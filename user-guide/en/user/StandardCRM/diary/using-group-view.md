# Use the group view

Once you have chosen other users and resources (see [Create group views](Creating-diary-views.md)), you are returned to the group view. This will now contain the selected users and resources.

If you click on the name of a user or resource, this user or resource becomes the owner of the diary, and you are taken directly to the **Day** tab of this user or resource. To return to your own diary, select your name from the diary owner list (see [View another diary](Viewing-another-diary.md)).
