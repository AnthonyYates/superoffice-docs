# Create appointments for associates

When you have opened the diary of an associate on the screen (see [Create group views](Creating-diary-views.md)), you can create appointments for this person yourself. Do this as follows:

1. Click the **View** tab in the **Diary** screen.
2. Find the person's diary in the **View** (see [Use the group view](Using-group-view.md)).
3. Create a new appointment in this diary using the mouse (see [Create follow-ups from the Diary](Creating-appointments-using-Diary.md)). The **Appointment** dialog opens.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have checked **Participants from group view** under **Preferences**, all members of the view are automatically added as participants in the appointment. To change this preference, go to ![icon][img1] **Personal settings &gt; Preferences &gt; Functions** and set the **Participants from group view** preference to **Yes**. Click **Save**.

1. Choose the participants to include (see [Add participants to follow-ups](Linking-participants-to-follow-ups.md)), if they are not automatically included.
2. Enter the required information in the fields. [!include[See Appointment dialog](../../includes/see-apt-dialog.md)]
3. Click the **Save** button. The appointment will be displayed in the selected person's diary.
