# View group views for an entire user group

Under [Create group views](Creating-diary-views.md) is a description of how you can view the diaries of other users and resources in your organisation by displaying group views in your diary. If you want to view the diaries of all users in a specific user group, there is a simple way to do that:

1. Click the **View** tab in the **Diary** screen.
2. Click the **Show** list box at the bottom of the **Diary** screen. This brings up a list of all the groups and resources that are set up in your organisation.
3. Select the required group from the list. The **View** tab now contains the diaries of all the users and resources in the selected user group.
