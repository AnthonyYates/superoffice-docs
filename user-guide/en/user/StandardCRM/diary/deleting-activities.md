# Delete activities

You can delete activities from any screen where they are displayed (see [Activities in SuperOffice CRM](index.md)), as follows:

1. Select one or more activities which you want to delete.
2. Right-click the selected activity or activities and select **Delete**.

> [!NOTE]
> On the **Activities** section tab, you can also select the activity and click the **Delete** button on the left, below the list.

A dialog opens asking you to confirm or cancel the deletion. For more details, see [Delete elements in SuperOffice CRM](../key-functions/Deleting-elements-in-CRM.md).
