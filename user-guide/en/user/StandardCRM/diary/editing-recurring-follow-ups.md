# Edit repeating follow-ups

You can make changes to all repeating follow-ups of which you are the owner (for more details, see [The Details tab](Details-tab-follow-ups.md)). Changes work in the same way as described under [Edit follow-ups](Editing-follow-ups.md), but when you make a change, the **Repeating follow-ups** dialog appears, giving a brief description of the follow-up.

In the **Repeating follow-ups** dialog, you have two options:

* If you select **Change only this instance**, the change will not affect other times.
* If you select **Change all future instances including this one**, the change will apply to this follow-up in the future as well.
