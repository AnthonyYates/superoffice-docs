# Compose an email

![icon](../media/Knapperad-E-post.bmp)

No matter where you are in SuperOffice CRM, you can compose a new e-mail message by clicking the **New** button in the top bar.

A simple way to create an e-mail message:

[!include[How to compose an email](../../includes/howto-compose-email.md)]

When you have finished the message, and want to send it, you have the following options:

* To send the message straightaway, click the **Send** button.
* To send the message and archive it as a document in SuperOffice CRM, click **Send and archive**. The **Document** dialog opens. See [Create new documents](Creating-new-documents.md).

> [!TIP]
> If you do not archive the message when you send it, you can still go to the sent folder and archive the message as described in [Archive incoming e-mail](../email/archive-buttons.md).

> [!TIP]
> The signature template at the bottom of the message can be edited in ![icon][img1] **Personal settings** &gt; **Edit personal signature**.
