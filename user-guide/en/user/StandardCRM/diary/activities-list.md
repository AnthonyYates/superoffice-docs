# The Activities section tab (Diary)

![icon](../media/Chap05-diary/42-chap5-activities-detail.bmp)

The **Activities** section tab gives you an overview of activities and acts as a to-do list or task list. It contains, among other things, appointments and tasks that you have not yet completed and you can use it to temporarily store follow-ups which you have not yet allocated to a particular time or date.

The activities list does not change when you switch between the different tabs in the top section of the **Diary** screen.

The activities list columns contain the following information:

* ![icon](../media/Salg-solgt-detaljkort.bmp) : The first column in the activities list specifies the **Completed** status of an activity. A tick in the checkbox (![icon](../media/Utfoert.bmp)) means that the activity is completed, while an empty box means that it is not completed. For more details on the **Completed** status, see [Change Completed status of an activity](Marking-activities-as-completed-not-completed.md).

> [!TIP]
> To change the **Completed** status of an activity simply click the box.

* The second column contains icons that indicate the type of activity, for example, a telephone for a call. These icons reflect the text in the **Type** column.
* <!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->
    [!include[Table showing icons for activities](../../includes/table-activity-icons.md)]
* The remainder of the columns in the activities list show other information about the activity (see the field descriptions in [The Dialog for follow-ups](Dialog-for-followups.md)). If not all the text in a field is visible, hold the mouse pointer over it to display it in a tooltip.

Once an activity is completed, it will be removed from the activities list by the next day. By default, the **Activities** section tab displays tasks that you have not completed as of todayâ€™s date. But you can also choose to display future tasks:

1. Go to ![icon][img1] **Personal settings &gt; Preferences**.
2. Select **Functions** and find the **Show days ahead** option. Here, you define how many days ahead you want completed activities to be visible for. For example, entering 7 here would display tasks for the next week.

If you want activities to be removed from the activities list as soon as they are completed, you can set this as a preference.

1. Go to ![icon][img1] **Personal settings &gt; Preferences**.
2. Select **Visual effects**, and then edit the **Remove completed activities** preference as described in the [Preferences](../key-functions/Preferences.md) topic.

If an activity is highlighted in red type, this means that its provisional date has been passed. However, you can change this setting as follows:

1. Go to ![icon][img1] **Personal settings &gt; Preferences**.
2. Select **Functions**, and edit the **Mark overdue activities** option.
