# Receive invitations

![icon](../../media/globalmenu-notice-new.png)

Participants who are invited to a follow-up will receive a notification on the Top bar. Click the **Notifications** icon to view the invitations(s).

<!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->

The dialog is divided into two:

* At the top is a list of your invitations, with status and icons.
* Below is more detailed information about the invitations you have selected in the top section. This includes a full description of the invitation, the date and other complementary details. The fields in this section are described in detail under [The Dialog for follow-ups](Dialog-for-followups.md) and [The Details tab (follow-ups)](Details-tab-follow-ups.md).

## Icons for follow-ups

The icons in the list of invitations show information about the follow-up you are invited to:

| Icon | Description |
|---|---|
| ![icon](../media/invitation-accepted.bmp) | Icon for follow-ups you have accepted an invitation to. |
| ![icon](../media/invitasjon-avslått.bmp) | Icon for follow-ups you have declined. These follow-ups stay in the **Invitations** dialog until the day after the follow-up takes place, so that you retain the option of changing your mind. |
| ![icon](../media/Recurring-booking-assignment.bmp) | Repeating follow-up. |

## Filter the display

To get a better overview of your invitations, you can filter the view using three checkboxes:

* Check **Show responses** if you want to display rejection messages from others you have invited.
* Check **Show declined** to display follow-ups you yourself have declined.
* Check **Show repetitions** to show repeating follow-ups. If the invitation concerns a repeating follow-up, all instances of the follow-up are shown in the **Invitations** dialog. You can then either accept or decline them individually.

> [!TIP]
> It is often a good idea to check **Show repetitions** so you can decide if you are able to attend each individual meeting. If you want to accept them all at once, uncheck **Show repetitions** again, select the row with the relevant follow-up and select **Accept**.

Check all three if you want to show all this information at the same time.

If you do not check any of these options, all that is displayed are follow-ups you are invited to but have not yet made a decision on.

## Accept or decline invitations

When you select one of the invitations in the top part of the dialog, its details are displayed underneath. The active follow-up is emboldened. Accept or decline the invitation by clicking **Accept** or **Decline**:

| Action | Description |
|---|---|
| Accept | Says yes to the invitation. A green tick is displayed to the left of your name in the list of participants in the bottom pane. The follow-up is moved from the **Invitations** dialog to your diary. |
| Decline | Says no to the selected invitation. A red cross is displayed to the left of your name in the list of participants in the bottom pane. The follow-up is removed from the **Invitations** dialog. The **Reason for declining** dialog opens, where you can enter the reason you are declining the invitation. |

> [!TIP]
> When you select an invitation in the **Invitations** dialog, the day in question is shown in the **Diary** screen in the background, so that you can check whether you have other appointments or not.  
If you have other overlapping appointments, a **Conflict** icon (![icon](../media/invitation-dialog-exclamation-mark.bmp)) is also displayed in the preview in the **Invitations** dialog.

## Receive invitations to repeating follow-ups

If you select **Show repetitions** below the list of invitations, all instances of the follow-up are displayed.

There are two ways to see if a follow-up is a repeating one:

* The status icon ( ![icon](../media/Recurring-booking-assignment.bmp) ) is shown in the list of invitations.
* You will see a 'repeat' icon at the top left of the bottom section of the dialog. See [Create repeating follow-ups](Creating-recurring-follow-ups.md) for more information about repeating follow-ups.

Click **Close** to close the dialog.

Note:

* If you first accept an invitation and then delete the follow-up from the diary, it is counted as though you declined it. The follow-up disappears from the Diary and your name is marked with a red cross ( ![icon](../media/invitasjon-avslått.bmp) ) in the **Appointment**, **Task** or **Phone Call** dialog of the person who sent the invitation. [!include[See Appointment dialog](../../includes/see-apt-dialog.md)]
* If you accept an invitation and subsequently open the dialog for follow-ups, you are not able to edit any information about the follow-up except for the **Priority**, **Completed** and **Alarm** fields. Other changes can only be made by the person who sent the invitation.
* If you assign a follow-up to another user (i.e. the follow-up changes owner), and the recipient declines it, this works as described under [Receive responses to invitations](Receive-response.md).
* If you close the **Invitations** dialog without accepting or declining the invitation, the follow-up remains there and an eye icon ( ![icon](../media/eye-icon.bmp) ) is displayed next to your name in the **Appointment**, **Task** or **Phone Call** dialog to show that you have seen it, but not made a decision.
* Invitations are saved up until the day after the follow-up is marked as completed so that the participants can be informed of changes.
* If you receive an invitation for a time when you are already occupied, an exclamation mark ( ![icon](../media/invitation-dialog-exclamation-mark.bmp) ) is displayed in the description of the follow-up in the **Invitations** dialog. This draws your attention to the fact that the invitation causes a conflict.
