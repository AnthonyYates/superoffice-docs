# The Note function in SuperOffice CRM

To insert an important comment in SuperOffice CRM, use the note function.

The note function attaches a note to the current company, contact, sale, project or selection card.

> [!NOTE]
> To create a note without fastening it to any specific item in SuperOffice CRM, use the Notepad function instead (see [Notepad](../key-functions/Notepad.md)).

## Create a note Web

1. Go to the required company, contact, sale, selection or project.
2. Select the **Note** tab and click **Edit**.
3. Type in the required information on the note.
4. Click **Save**.

A dot on the **Note** tab indicates that a note has been added.

## Delete a note

To delete a note, simply delete all the text in the note. The dot disappears from the **Note** tab.
