# Change Completed status of an activity

When you consider that an activity is finished, you can mark it as completed.

**Completed** is a toggle option, which means that you activate and deactivate it using the same menu option or shortcut key. A tick specifies that the activity is **Completed**.

To change the **Completed** status of an activity:

* Open the activity and uncheck the **Completed** icon at the top-right of the dialog.

> [!TIP]
> For more information about how to open activities, see the [Open follow-ups](Opening-Follow-ups.md) and [Open documents](Opening-documents.md) topics.

* Hold the mouse pointer over the box in the **Completed** column (![icon][img2]) in the **Activities** section tab. Then click the checkbox ( ![icon][img1] ).

> You cannot edit completed activities until you have changed their **Completed** status.
