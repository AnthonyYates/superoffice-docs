# The Sales section tab (Diary)

![icon](../media/Chap05-diary/chap5-sales-detail.bmp)

In addition to the [Activities section tab](activities-list.md), the Diary also contains the **Sales** section tab, which shows essential information about sales.

The following data is displayed:

* the date of the next activity recorded for the sale (the oldest follow-up that has not yet been completed)

    > [!TIP]
    > If you want to know what this next follow-up is, double-click the sale to open the **Sale** screen. The follow-up can be viewed in the **Activities** section tab of the sale.

* the current stage of the sale (see [Enter information in the Sale tab](../sale/CreateSale-Sale-tab.md))

* the sale amount

* the name of the company the sale is linked to

* any contact the sale is linked to

* the name of the sale

* the sale date (estimated, sold or lost)

* a status icon for the sale, showing whether it is sold ( ![icon](../media/Salg-solgt-detaljkort.bmp) ), lost ( ![icon](../media/Salg-tapt-detaljkort.bmp) ) or stalled ( ![icon](../media/Salg-utsatt-detaljkort.bmp) ) (if there is no icon, the sale is "open") (see [Stalled, sold and lost sales](../sale/Status-of-a-sale-sold-and-lost.md))

Sales not marked as completed are shown in this list.

The **Sales** section tab functions as a kind of "sales secretary" to help you keep an overview of your sales. For more details, see [Sales secretary](sales-secretary.md).
