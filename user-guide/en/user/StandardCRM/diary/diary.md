# Diary

The diary in SuperOffice CRM is used much like a filofax and has separate pages for every day, week and month.

The diary is a useful tool when you want to plan and perform different types of tasks. From the diary, you can view, edit and delete activities. (See [Manage follow-ups in the Diary](Managing-follow-ups-in-the-diary.md) and [Activities in SuperOffice CRM](index.md)).

You also get a list of sales to work on, using the **Sales** section tab in the **Diary** screen (see [Sales secretary](sales-secretary.md)).

The **Diary** screen consists of two main sections:

* A calendar showing follow-ups that have been allocated to a particular time or date. (See [Tabs in the Diary screen](Tabs-in-the-Diary-screen.md)).
* A section tab area, which comprises the activities list (see [Activities section tab](activities-list.md)) and the sales list (see [The Sales section tab](Sale-card.md)).

At the bottom left of the calendar is a field for selecting a time zone, if time zones have been enabled in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance (see [Time zones](Time-zones.md)).
