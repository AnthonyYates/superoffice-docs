# Create tasks

To create a new task, choose **New** &gt; **Task** on the [top bar](../chap01/Buttons-in-the-menu-bar.md).

The **Task** dialog opens. Here you specify the task details as described under [The dialog for follow-ups](Dialog-for-followups.md). When you create a new task, no time is displayed in the **Start** and **Due** fields. Today's date is inserted automatically, but you can change it to the required date. The date indicates the deadline for the task.
