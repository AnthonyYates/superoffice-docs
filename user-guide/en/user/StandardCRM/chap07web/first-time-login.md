# The first time you log in

To access e-mail, you need to specify some details about your e-mail account. The **Set up e-mail account** screen appears the first time you open your inbox.

To enter the required information in this window:

1. In the **E-mail account** field, enter the e-mail address of the account you want to use in SuperOffice.
2. If you want to enter information for incoming and outgoing e-mail, click **Advanced settings**. If not, click **Next**. SuperOffice will then try to set up this information for you.
3. In the **Password** field, enter your password.
4. Click **Log in**. If SuperOffice recognizes the e-mail provider (such as Gmail), the server settings will be set up automatically and the inbox will load. If not, the settings screen will display and you must fill in the required fields.

Some e-mail providers, such as Gmail, will block login attempts from unknown apps. Check your inbox to see if your e-mail provider has sent you information about an unauthorized login attempt. Follow the instructions in the e-mail to allow SuperOffice to access your account.
