# Archive incoming e-mail

You can archive an incoming e-mail (including any attachments) as a document in SuperOffice CRM. This is a convenient way of storing information you have received via e-mail together with other company/contact information in SuperOffice CRM.

In order to do so:

1. Go to the inbox or the relevant folder.
2. Select the required message.
3. Click **Archive** ![icon](../media/web-email-archive-SMALL.bmp).
4. Click **Archive e-mail**. The **Document** dialog opens. See [The Document dialog](../chap02/Document-dialog.md).

<!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->

This can mean one of the following:

* The sender's e-mail address is not registered in SuperOffice CRM. To add the sender to SuperOffice CRM, see [Add e-mail addresses in SuperOffice CRM](Adding-e-mail-addresses-in-CRM.md).
* The sender's e-mail address is registered on more than one contact or company in SuperOffice CRM. Select the correct contact under **This contact could be**.

If you do not want to register this e-mail address in SuperOffice CRM, click **Do not add contact to SuperOffice** to go to the **Document** dialog.
