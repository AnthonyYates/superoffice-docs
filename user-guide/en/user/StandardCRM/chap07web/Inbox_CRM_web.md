# Inbox (Web)

The inbox in SuperOffice CRM is based on a separate e-mail client which gives you access to your e-mail via the Internet, without requiring you to have an e-mail program installed locally on your PC. In this main topic we explain how to use this e-mail facility.

<!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->

Click the **Inbox** button in the Navigator.

> [!TIP]
> If you click the word **Inbox** instead of the actual button, a list is displayed, from which you can choose the e-mail folder you want to go to.

The **Inbox** screen consists of the following main sections:

* On the left side of the screen is the inbox. You can easily switch between, for example, the inbox and sent e-mails.
* On the right, you can view the selected message and perform various actions.
