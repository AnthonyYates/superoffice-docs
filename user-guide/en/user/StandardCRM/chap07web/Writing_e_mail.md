# Compose an e-mail

> [!TIP]
> The procedure below describes how to compose an e-mail message from the inbox. You can also compose an e-mail message by clicking **New &gt; E-mail** on the top bar.

To create an e-mail from the inbox in SuperOffice CRM:

1. Go to the inbox and click **New** to compose a new e-mail.  
    or  
    Click the arrow next to the **New** button to select or search for an e-mail template. If the **New e-mail** dialog displays, see [Entering information in the New e-mail dialog](Writing_e_mail.md#New_email_dlg).

1. Click in the **To** field, and start typing the name of the contact you want to send the message to.

2. Select a contact in the list of results. You can also click ![icon](../media/navigator_history_small.png) to select a recent contact.

3. Repeat step 2 and 3 to add additional recipients.

4. Optional: Click **Cc/Bcc** to send copies or blind copies to other recipients.

5. In the **Subject** field, enter a brief description of what the message is about.

6. Click the message field and type in your message.

7. To include an attachment in the message, click ![icon](../media/web_email_add_attachment_SMALL.bmp) at the bottom of the window. In the **Attachment** section that displays at the top of the window, you have the following options:

    * Click **Upload files (or drag here)** to browse to and add a file from a disk or server.
    * Drag and drop a file from Windows Explorer to the **Attachment** section.
    * Click **Select a CRM document** to select a document in SuperOffice CRM.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you want to save the message temporarily and complete it later, click ![icon](media/window_close.png) in the top-right corner. The message will then be saved in the drafts folder.

8. To include an FAQ, a reply template or a quick reply in the e-mail message, click ![icon](../../Chat/media/chat_btn_FAQ.png) at the bottom of the window. <!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->.
    Select one of the following options and browse the folders. You can also enter search text in the top field, or click the relevant icons to access history and favourites.

    * **FAQ**: Inserts a link to an FAQ in SuperOffice Customer Centre. Only FAQs that are accessible to everyone and that are published, are available here.
    * **Reply templates**: Inserts the template text.
    * **Quick replies**: Inserts a <!-- Fix reuse ID=a2 -->(A quick reply is a pre-defined text that you can use in an e-mail message. It is similar to reply templates, but it is much easier and faster to create a quick reply. The quick replies you create will only be available to you.).

    To create quick replies:

    1. Click ![icon](../../Chat/media/chat_btn_edit.png) **Edit**. The **Quick replies** windows opens.
    2. Click **Add**. A new reply is added to the list.
    3. Click the **New name** field and enter a title for the quick reply. This will not be visible to the customer.
    4. Click the **New content** field and enter the reply text you want to send to customers.
    5. Click **Save**. The window closes and the new quick reply is saved.

When you have finished the message, and want to send it, you have the following options:

* To send the message straightaway, click the **Send** button.
* To send the message and archive it as a document in SuperOffice CRM, click **Send and archive**. The **Document** dialog opens. See [Create new documents](../chap02/Creating_new_documents.md).

> [!TIP]
> If you do not archive the message when you send it, you can still go to the sent folder and archive the message as described in [Archive incoming e-mail](archive_buttons.md).

> [!TIP]
> The signature template at the bottom of the message can be edited in ![icon](../media/globalmenu_personalsettings_small.png)**Personal settings** &gt; **Edit personal signature**.

## Entering information in the New e-mail dialog

If you create a new e-mail based on a template, the **New e-mail** dialog will in some cases display. This is due to a setting in the template to allow you to add additional information to the e-mail. This is especially relevant when using templates with template variables for sales and projects, where you must select the relevant sale or project for the variables to be filled in when you send the e-mail.

Fill in the fields below, click **Create** and compose the e-mail as described above.

**\[Document template\]**

Click the arrow ( ![icon](../media/Dialogboksknapper_pil_ned.bmp) ) next to the type field at the top of the dialog to display a list of document templates that you can choose from. The available templates are defined in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.

\[Company\]

Enter here the name of the company you are writing to.

\[Contact\]

Click the arrow next to this field and a list of known contacts in the company is displayed.

Project

Enter the name of the project that the e-mail should be linked to.

Sale

Enter the name of the sale that the e-mail should be linked to.

**Visible for**

Click the **Visible for** field to display a list that allows you to choose whether the e-mail will be visible to all users, only yourself, or visible to all users in one of the user groups that the owner belongs to.

Language

If the selected template includes translated versions, you can select a language for the template.
