# Create request

This feature allows you to quickly add a request in SuperOffice Service based on the sender and the text content in the e-mail message.

In order to do so:

1. Go to the inbox.
2. Select the required message in the inbox.
3. Click **Archive** ![icon](../media/web-email-archive-SMALL.bmp).
4. Click **Create request**. The **Create request** dialog opens.
5. Fill in the relevant fields.
6. Click **Save**.
    * If the sender's e-mail address is recognised, the request is automatically linked to the correct contact and company.
    * If the sender's e-mail address is not recognised, the sender is automatically registered as a new contact in SuperOffice Service.
