# Archive outgoing e-mail

To send a message and archive it as a document in SuperOffice CRM, click **Send and archive** when you are writing an e-mail message. See [Compose an e-mail](Writing-e-mail.md).

**Tip**: If you do not archive the message when you send it, you can still go to the sent folder and archive the message as described in [Archive incoming e-mail](archive-buttons.md).
