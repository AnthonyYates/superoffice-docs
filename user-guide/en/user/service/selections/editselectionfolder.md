# Administrate folders of selections

Under **Selections** &gt; **List selections** you can create a folder structure for the selections, to give them a logical structure and make it easy for others to find information. You can create sub-folders in all folders, and you can place the selections in any of these folders. Find out more below about how to work with the folder structure.
