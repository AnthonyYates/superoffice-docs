# Delete a selection

If you want to delete a selection, you do not delete the actual records it contains. They will remain in the system, but will no longer be available as a collected dataset under **Selection**. Proceed as follows:

> [!NOTE]
> In order to delete a selection, you need to have access to both read and edit the selection in question.

1. Select **Selections** &gt; **List selections**. This takes you to the **List selections** screen.
2. Point at the selection name, to make the icons appear to the right.
3. Click the **Edit selection** icon ( ![icon][img1] ). This takes you to the **Edit selection** screen.
4. Click **Delete**.
5. When asked if you are sure you want to delete the selection, click **OK**.
