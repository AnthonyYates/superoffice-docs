# Delete records in a selection

If you want to delete the actual records in a selection, do as follows:

> [!NOTE]
> This option is not available for all selections. It depends on the type of records you selected in the **Source table** field when you created the selection (see [Create a selection](newSelection.md)).

1. Select **Selections** &gt; **List selections**. This takes you to the **List selections** screen.
2. Click the required selection. The selection is opened so that you can see which records it contains.
3. Select all the entries, or as many as you want.
4. Click the ![icon][img1] menu button in the lower left corner and select **Batch management**.
5. Select **Delete** from the list of displayed options.
6. Click **OK** in the screen which appears, to confirm that you want to delete that number of entries.
7. If you also want to delete the selection itself, see [Delete a selection](deleteSelection.md).
