# Macros and scripts

In the **Macros and scripts** tab you will find a list of the scripts and macros in the system, grouped in folders. Click a script or macro in the list to view, edit or run it (see [View a script/macro][1]).

About macros

Macros are the user-friendly version of scripts: You don’t need extensive knowledge about scripting or CRMScript to create macros.

With macro’s you are able to customize and automate actions inside SuperOffice. It comes with an easy to use wizard that will help you setup your macro.
