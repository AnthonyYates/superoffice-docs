# Create e-mail addresses

When you register e-mail addresses under **Knowledge Base** &gt; **E-mail addresses**, they become available in most places where you need to send e-mail, such as in the **New request** and **Add message** screens. This speeds up request processing.

To register an e-mail address:

1. Select **Knowledge Base** &gt; **E-mail addresses**.

2. Go to the folder you want to put the e-mail address in. If it does not yet exist, you can create a new folder. See [Administrate e-mail address folders](emailAddressBook.editEabFolder.md).

3. Click the **New e-mail address** button. This takes you to the **E-mail address properties** screen.

4. The **Folder** field automatically shows the name of the folder you chose. If you change your mind, you can click the list button ( ![icon](../../../../media/icons/btn-dropdown.png) ) and select a different folder in the list that appears.

5. In the **Name** field, enter the name of the person the e-mail address belongs to.

6. In the **E-mail address** field, enter the person's e-mail address.

7. <!-- online --> In the **Mobile phone number** field, you can enter their mobile number. This can be used to send messages by SMS.

8. Click **OK**. The e-mail address is added to the specified folder and will be available the next time you want to send an e-mail.
