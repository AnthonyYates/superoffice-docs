# Search for documents

If there are lots of documents in a folder, it may be difficult to find the one you want. In that case, doing a search may be a good idea. To do this:

1. Select **Knowledge Base** &gt; **Documents**.
2. Go to the folder where the document is located.
3. Point at the folder name, to make the icons appear to the right.
4. Click the **Search** button. This takes you to the **Criteria** screen.
5. Search as described under [Search in SuperOffice Service](../search/index.md).
