# Work with e-mail addresses

Under **Knowledge Base &gt; E-mail addresses** you can create a list of e-mail addresses that you often use, but which are not registered for users or contacts in SuperOffice Service. These might be, for example, suppliers, partners or product specialists. These addresses are accessible in most places where you need to send e-mail, such as in the **New request** and **Add message** screens.
