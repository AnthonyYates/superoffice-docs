# Search for requests

If you are looking for a request in the system and cannot find it using the predefined searches as described under [Use lists][1], you can do as follows:

1. Select **Requests &gt; Find requests**. This takes you to the **Criteria** screen.
2. Enter the required search criteria. See [Search in SuperOffice Service][2] to find out how to define search criteria.
3. Click **Search**.
4. Under **Find requests** are the requests that match your search criteria. If you select one of the requests in the list, its contents are displayed in the preview screen on the right. If you select one of the requests in the list, its contents are displayed in the preview section. <!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->
