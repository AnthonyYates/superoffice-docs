# Request handling step by step

Different companies have different routines for request handling and can use SuperOffice Service in different ways. Below we have set up two scenarios showing some of the available options.

## Scenario 1: The customer submits the request by e-mail

1. The customer writes an e-mail to support@company.com or fills out a form in a user-support portal.
2. The customer receives automatic acknowledgement of receipt of the enquiry. See [Work with reply templates](../reply-templates/index.md).
3. The enquiry from the customer is automatically registered as a request in SuperOffice Service.
4. The request ends up with a request handler in SuperOffice Service. See [Receive requests](receiveTickets.md) and [Find requests](listTickets.md).
5. The request handler reads through the request. See [List requests](listTicket.md).
6. The request handler is unable to fulfil the request on his own and does one of the following:
    * Asks a colleague. See [Ask another request handler for help](showListTickets.askForHelp.md).
    * Gets help from outside. See [Forward messages to external parties](showListTickets.forward.md).
7. The request handler sends a response to the customer. See [Reply to customer](showListTickets.addMessage.md).
8. The request handler closes the request and proceeds to deal with other requests. See [Close requests](showListTickets.closeTickets.md).

## Scenario 2: The customer calls the request handler

1. The customer has a problem with a product and calls user-support.
2. The request handler who answers the call registers the request. See [Create requests](newTicket.md).
3. The request handler is unable to fulfil the request on his own and does one of the following:
    * Asks a colleague. See [Ask another request handler for help](showListTickets.askForHelp.md).
    * Gets help from outside. See [Forward messages to external parties](showListTickets.forward.md).
4. The request handler sends a response to the customer. See [Reply to customer](showListTickets.addMessage.md).
5. The request handler closes the request and proceeds to deal with other requests. See [Close requests](showListTickets.closeTickets.md).
