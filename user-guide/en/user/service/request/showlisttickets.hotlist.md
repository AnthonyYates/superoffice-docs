# Add requests to the favourites list

In SuperOffice Service there is a favourites list, to which you can add requests you want to remind yourself to follow up.

> [!TIP]
> You can also add contacts, companies, selections and mailings to your favourites. These favourites can be accessed by clicking the relevant icon in the Navigator and clicking ![icon][img3]. See [Favourites][1].

## Add requests to the favourites list

<!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->
How can I add multiple requests to the favourites list?

1. Search for the relevant requests.
2. Click the checkbox next to each request you want to add to the favourites list.
3. Click ![icon][img5] in the lower left corner of the list.
4. Select **Batch management &gt; Add to my favourites**.

Add requests to the faviourites list:

1. Open the request. (See [Process requests][3].)
2. Click the favourites icon ( ![icon][img1] ) in the request header. The star turns yellow ![icon][img2], and the request is instantly added to favourites. You do not have to click **Save**.

> [!TIP]
> Before transferring responsibility for the request to someone else (see [Ask another request handler for help][2]), it is a good idea to add it to your favourites list, to remind yourself to follow it up. It will no longer be displayed under **Own open requests** when someone else is defined in the **Owner** field.

## View the favourites list

To view the favourites list, do one of the following:

* Select **Requests** in the Navigator, and click ![icon][img3].
* Select **Requests** in the Navigator, and select **My favourites**.

## Remove requests from the favourites list
