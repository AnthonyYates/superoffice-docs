# Batch update users

In this screen you can update several users at the same time.

To do this:

1. Select ![icon][img1] **System settings &gt; Users**.
2. Select the **Users** tab.
3. Click the **Filter** list to apply a filter to the list.
4. Check the users you want to update.
5. Click the ![icon](../../../../media/icons/btn-menu.png) menu button in the lower left corner, and select **Batch update** and **Change**.
6. In the **Batch update users** screen, check the box(es) for the property or properties you want to change, and then select the value you want in the associated field. The following options are available:
    * **Role**: Select a role you want to assign to the selected users. For more details about roles, see [Roles](listRoles.md).

        > [!NOTE]
        > The role may override other options further down.

    * **Status**: Select the required status for the selected users. You can choose between **Normal** and **Not present**. If a user is not present, they will not receive any requests automatically. This is the status you would set, for example, when users go on holiday.

    * **Language**: Select which language the SuperOffice Service interface should be in for the selected users. You can choose from Norwegian, English, German, Swedish, Danish and Dutch.

    * **Sort messages in descending order**: Checking here causes the messages in a request to be sorted with the most recent at the top.

    * **Preview image attachments in messages**: Checking here causes images attached to messages to be previewed in the **Request** screen.

    * **New window when adding a message to a request**: Checking here causes a new browser window to be opened when the selected users add a message.

    * **List only requests in own categories**: Check here to display only requests in the categories that the selected users are members of.

    * **Automatically quote the last message**: If you check here, the last message in the request is automatically pasted into the text field in the new message.

    * **Show only own categories**: If you check here, you can only select categories you are a member of.

    * If extra fields have been added for users, you can also change these.
7. Click **OK**. The selected users are updated with your changes.
