# Search for requests in categories

From the **Categories** screen, it is also possible to search for requests in a specific category. [!include[To do this](../../../includes/to-do-this.md)]

1. Select ![icon][img1]**System settings** &gt; **Categories**.

2. Point at the category in which you want to search, to make the icons appear to the right.

    > [!TIP]
    > If the category is a subcategory, you first need to click the plus sign to the left of the parent category in order to display the associated subcategories.

3. Click **Search** next to the category name. This takes you to the search screen.

4. Search as described under [Search for requests][1].
