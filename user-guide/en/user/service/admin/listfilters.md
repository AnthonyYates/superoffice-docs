# E-mail

[!include[Restricted access](../../../includes/note-insufficient-rights.md)]

In the **E-mail** screen, you control the mechanisms that manage inbound and outbound e-mail. E-mails are imported by SuperOffice Service regularly collecting e-mail from one or more mailboxes. These e-mail messages can be scanned by e-mail filters that process e-mails based on content and generate requests. Outbound e-mail (replies) from the system is placed in the outbox and sent regularly to an e-mail server that forwards the messages. Imported e-mails that are blocked (by a filter) are displayed in the **Blocked e-mail** tab and have to be reviewed manually.
