# Inbox for e-mail

In the **Inbox for e-mail** tab is a list of the e-mails in the queue to be read in. The following options are also available from the ![icon][img1] menu button:

* **Export**: Click here to export the list to a file. You can choose from these formats: Excel, HTML and plain text.

* **Delete**: Click here to delete the selected e-mails.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You cannot undo this operation.

If you click one of the messages in this tab, the **Inbound e-mail** screen appears. This contains information about that message. In the **Error message** field, you can see what caused the problem, for example, if there is a problem with the e-mail address or the e-mail server. If you get an error from SuperOffice Service, you can click **Import with debug** to display technical information to help user support with troubleshooting.
