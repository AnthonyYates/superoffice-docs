# Invoice statistics

The **Invoicing basis for companies and contacts** screen provides a list of the invoicing basis per company. Note that these statistics may take some time to calculate. There are no options for these statistics, and only chargeable hours for companies will be shown. Companies with no chargeable hours are not shown. Clicking the name of an entry takes you to a screen showing the [invoicing basis][1] for the company or contact.
