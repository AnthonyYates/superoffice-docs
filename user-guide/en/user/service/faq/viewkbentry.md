# View FAQ entries

To display the contents of an FAQ entry in the knowledge base:

1. Select **Knowledge Base** &gt; **FAQ**. This takes you to the **FAQ** screen, which contains FAQ entries in a folder structure that you can create yourself. See [Administrate folders of FAQ entries][1].
2. If the list contains several subfolders, go to the one you require.
3. Click the FAQ entry you want. The **FAQ entry** screen appears and comprises two tabs:
    * **Overview**: Here you can see the question, answer and other details that make up the FAQ entry.
    * **Comments**: This contains any feedback that customers have added via the customer centre. See [Handling comments in FAQ entries][2].

To edit the current FAQ entry, click the **Edit entry** button. See [Edit FAQ entries][3].

To publish or unpublish the current FAQ entry, click the **Move forward in workflow** button or the **Move backward in workflow** button. See [Publish FAQ entries][4].
