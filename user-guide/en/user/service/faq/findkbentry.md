# Search for FAQ entries

If there are lots of FAQ entries in a folder, it may be difficult to find the one you want. In that case, doing a search may be a good idea. [!include[To do this](../../../includes/to-do-this.md)]

1. Select **Knowledge Base** &gt; **FAQ**.
2. Click the **Search** button. This takes you to the **Criteria** screen.
3. Search as described under [Search in SuperOffice Service][1].

> [!TIP]
> Perhaps you should consider creating a folder structure to make it easier to locate relevant FAQ entries? See [Administrate folders of FAQ entries][2].
