# Publish FAQ entries

When a request handler creates a suggestion for an FAQ entry (see [Create FAQ entries from a request](newKbEntry.md)), it will be unpublished and unavailable in SuperOffice Customer Centre. To make it available, it needs to be published. This is done by a person who has FAQ administration rights.

1. When you log in, any unpublished FAQ entries are shown on the **Status** tile on the dashboard, under **Unpublished FAQ entries**. See [Requests](../request/index.md).
2. Click on the required entry. The **FAQ entry** screen opens.
3. Click **Edit entry**. The **FAQ entry properties** screen opens.
4. Select the **Question** and **Answer** tabs, and read through the question and answer.
5. If required, edit the question and answer to make them suitable for an FAQ entry and hence reusable.
6. Select the **Properties** tab.
7. Publish the FAQ entry by selecting **Published** in the **Workflow** field.
8. Make any other required changes in the **Properties** tab. For more information about the fields in this screen, see [Create FAQ entries](newKbEntry.md).
9. Click **OK**. The FAQ entry is now available for use.
