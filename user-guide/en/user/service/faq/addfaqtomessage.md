# Add FAQ entries to messages

When you respond to a customer enquiry, you can save time by inserting a link to an FAQ entry in your reply. To do this:

1. Go to the **Message** tab, as described under [Reply to customer](../request/showListTickets.addMessage.md).
2. Position the mouse pointer in the message where you want to insert the link.
3. In the **Insert** field, first click **FAQ entry** and then the entry you want.  
    or  
    Click **Add text** (![icon](../../../../media/icons/service/btn-add-text.png)) in the toolbar, click the folder icon (![icon](../../../../media/icons/service/folder.png)), click **FAQ entry** and then the entry you want.
4. Click **Paste at cursor position**. A link is inserted which the customer can click to show the relevant FAQ entry in the customer centre.

> [!TIP]
> You can also click **Preview** to display the selected item onscreen. If you select a message in the **Choose message** folder in the **Paste text** field and then click **Suggest FAQ**, a list of relevant FAQ entries for the selected message is displayed.
