# Navigate in SuperOffice Service

To move between the parts in SuperOffice Service, you click the buttons in the Navigator on the left of the screen.

When you click one of these buttons, you get access to various options, such as shortcuts, actions, history, favorites and search. See [Navigator options][6].
