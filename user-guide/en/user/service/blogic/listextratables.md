# Tables

[!include[Requirement](../../../includes/req-expander-services.md)]

In the **Tables** screen in **System design** there is a list of the tables in the system. Here you can extend the SuperOffice Service by creating new tables and fields for different screens in the system.

> [!TIP]
> Extra fields can for instance be used as search criteria and columns in sales.

This screen displays both standard tables, predefined in the system and which form the basis of different screens, and extra tables, which are tables you create yourself with optional content.

> [!NOTE]
> If your company uses SuperOffice CRM, you will see a message that NetServer must be restarted every time you add new fields/tables. If Travel is activated, you will also see a message that a new Travel database must be generated.
