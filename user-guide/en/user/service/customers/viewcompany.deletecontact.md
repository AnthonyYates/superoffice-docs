# Delete companies

If you delete a company, it is not completely removed from the system. It is just marked as deleted. [!include[To do this](../../../includes/to-do-this.md)]

1. Open the **Company** screen as described under [View companies][1].
2. Click the ![icon][img1] **Actions** button and select **Edit company**. The **Company properties** screen appears.
3. Click **Delete**.
4. Click **OK** when you are asked if you want to delete the company. The company is marked as deleted, but any associated contacts are not affected by this deletion.

> [!TIP]
> To undo the deletion of a company, follow the same procedure, but the button then becomes **Activate** instead of **Delete**.
