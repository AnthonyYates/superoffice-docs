# View search results for companies

Once you have got a list of companies by following the procedure under [Search for companies][1], you will be in a screen containing the following sections:

* **Criteria**: Here you enter search criteria to filter out which companies you wish to see. See [Search in SuperOffice Service][2].
* **Result**: This contains all the companies that match your search criteria. See [List search results for companies &gt; Result](#result).
* **Preview**: Displays the requests and contacts linked to the company selected under **Result**. See [List search results for companies &gt; Preview](#preview).

## Result

Contains a list of companies that match the criteria specified above. Here you can:

* Sort the companies by clicking the appropriate column heading.
* Select a row to display the requests and contacts linked to that company, under **Preview**.
* You can open a screen of information about the company by double-clicking the relevant row. See [View companies][3].

Under **Result** there are also the following buttons:

* **Export**: Click here to export the list under **Result** to a file. You can choose from these formats: Excel, HTML and plain text. If the list contains companies or contacts, you can also export it as a static selection to SuperOffice CRM.
* **Batch management**: If you select one or more companies under **Result**, you can click this button and select an action to perform on all the selected companies simultaneously. For example, you can merge records if the same company has been registered twice.

## Preview

This section of the screen displays the requests and contacts linked to the company selected under **Result**. Here you have the same options as described under [View companies][3].
