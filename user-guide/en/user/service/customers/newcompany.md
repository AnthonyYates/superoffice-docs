# Create companies

Contacts can be linked to companies:

* The system searches for the domain name registered for the company, so that all contacts with this domain in their e-mail address are automatically linked to the company.
* You can specify contacts' links to companies manually when you create them. See [Create contacts](newCustomer.md).

But you first need to register a company. [!include[To do this](../../../includes/to-do-this.md)]

1. Select **Customers** &gt; **New company**. This takes you to the **Company properties** screen.

2. Enter the company name and a department name (if applicable).

3. Enter the phone number, fax number and address including country.

4. In the **Main contact** list box, select who is to be the main contact for the company.

5. In the **Priority** list box, select the default priority to apply to new requests linked to this company. This setting will be overridden if a different priority is linked to the contact for a new request. Here you can choose between **Low**, **Medium** and **High** or any custom options. See also [Work with priorities](../topics/../admin/listPriorities.listPriorities.md).

6. In the **Our service contact** field, select the person who will handle service requests for this company.

7. In the **Our contact** list box, select the request handler who will be responsible for this company.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you want to specify you yourself as the request handler responsible, simply click the person icon next to the **Our contact** list box ( ![icon](../../../../media/icons/service/btn-active-user.png) ).

8. Click the **Category** list box, select the applicable category for the company. This list is maintained in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.

9. Click the **Business** list box, select the applicable business for the company. This list is maintained in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.

10. In the **Add domain** field, enter the company's Internet domain, for example, "company.com". You can add multiple domains by clicking the ![icon][img1] add button for each domain you want to add. These domains are used in particular to link contacts to companies automatically.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can delete a domain by clicking **Delete** ( ![icon][img2] ) to the right of the row.

11. Check **Link existing customers based on e-mail address** if you want to check existing contacts against the domains you have entered. If there are any contacts with e-mail addresses containing this domain name, and which are not already linked to another company, they will be automatically linked to the company.

12. In the **Notes** field, you can add any additional information about the company.

13. Click **OK**. The company is saved.
