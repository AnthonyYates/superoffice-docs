# Work with the recipient list after the mailing

After the mailing has been sent, SuperOffice Marketing collects data about the status of each sent e-mail. In the **Recipients** tab, you can view the status for each recipient of the mailing. You can also filter the list and export the results to selections and projects in SuperOffice CRM for further processing.

The selection may, for example, contain recipients who have read the mailing, so that salespersons can follow up on them. To improve your customer data, you can create a selection of recipients who have not received the mailing (return/bounce), so that the person who looks after this customer can ensure that the correct contact information is registered in SuperOffice CRM.

In order to do this:

1. Click the mailing in the **Mailings** tab. The **View mailing** screen opens.
2. Click the **Recipients** tab. The list shows the 100 first recipients, and you need to click ![icon][img1] to show the next 100.
3. Filter the list by using the checkboxes at the bottom of the list. By default all filters are active to show all recipients. See [Filter recipient list](Filter-recipient-list.md).
4. Use the checkboxes in the left column to select all or specific recipients.
5. Click the ![icon][img2] menu button. Here you have the following options:
    * Export the selected recipients to an Excel, HTML or text file.
    * Add the selected recipients to a new or existing selection or project. See [Add recipients to selections or projects](Add-recipients-to-selections-or-projects.md).
    * Resend the mailing to the selected recipients.
6. Click **Close** to close the **View mailing** screen.

If the status is **Ready to send**, you do not have to do anything. SuperOffice will send your mailing to the recipients. The status will be changed to **Sent** once this is done.

## Following up the mailing

* If the status is still sent **Sent** (and not **Read by recipient**) after a few days, you should send out a reminder. If you are sending out an invitation to an event or a seminar for example, it’s good to resend and remind those recipients who didn’t open and read your first mailing. You can create a new target list to resend your mailing.

* Once you’ve filtered out the recipients you wish to follow up on, you can export all recipients to a selection or a project in SuperOffice CRM. You can follow up on your recipients from this selection or Project. See [Add recipients to selections or projects](Add-recipients-to-selections-or-projects.md).
