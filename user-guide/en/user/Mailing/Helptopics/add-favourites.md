# Add favourites

The Favourites function gives you easy to access to your favourite mailings or forms.

## Add a mailing as a favourite

To add a mailing or form to your favourites, open it and click the star icon ![icon][img1] in the top-right corner. The star turns yellow ![icon][img2], and the mailing/form is instantly added to your favourites.

In SuperOffice Service you can now quickly access the record by clicking **Marketing** and then ![icon](../../media/navmenu-favourites.png) in the Navigator.

> [!TIP]
> If you hold the mouse pointer over a mailing or form in the favourites list, a tooltip is displayed containing additional data about the mailing or form.

## Remove a mailing or form from the favourites list

1. Open the mailing or form.
2. Click the favourites icon ( ![icon][img2] ) in the header. The icon changes to ![icon][img1].
