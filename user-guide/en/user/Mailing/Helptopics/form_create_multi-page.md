# Create multi-page forms

If you are creating a form with many fields, it might be useful to split the form into multiple pages. This will make the form more user-friendly and easier to read. The user can navigate using **Next** and **Previous** buttons, and you can also add a progress bar to indicate how much is left to fill in.

In order to do so:

1. Create a form as described in [Create a new form](form_create.md).
2. Go to the **Fields** category.
3. Click the **Add** button (![icon](../media/btn_Field_Add.png)). The **Add element** window opens.
4. Select **View elements**.
5. Select **Section** and click **Add**. The window closes and a section is added to the form. You can also see the section In the form preview.
6. Click ![icon](../media/btn_Field_Move.png) at the top of the section and drag it to the desired position in the form. The fields above and below the section will be on two separate pages in the form.
7. Click **Apply now** when you are done.
8. Repeat steps 2-7 to add another section.

**Tip**: You can add a progress bar to the form, so the user can see how much is left to fill in. Go to the **Style** category, click the check box next to **Progress bar colour**, and select a colour.
