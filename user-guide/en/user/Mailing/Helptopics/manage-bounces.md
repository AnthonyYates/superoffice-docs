# Manage bounces

You can manage bounces and blocked e-mails for individual mailings. To manage this for ALL mailings, see [Blocked e-mail addresses](Blocked-e-mail-addresses.md).

To fix a single e-mail address, select it in the list and click **Open** in the side-panel to edit the contact. Go to the **Details** tab. A warning icon (![icon](../media/warning-asterisk-red.png)) next to the e-mail address indicates a problem. Hold the mouse-pointer over the icon to view the cause of the problem.

> [!TIP]
> Click a column to access sorting and grouping functions.
