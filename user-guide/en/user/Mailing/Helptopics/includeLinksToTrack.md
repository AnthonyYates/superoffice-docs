# Include links you want to track

**Note!** This feature requires the Marketing User licence.

You can include links (URLs) in a message and track them. In other words, you can see how many recipients have clicked the links and who has clicked them. Read more about tracking in [Examples of the use of trackable links](Examples_of_the_use_of_trackable_links.md).

To add tracked links to the message:

Go to the contents of the message and edit a section (see [Edit content](Edit_a_paragraph.md)).

Select the text or image which the recipient has to click.

* To add an existing tracked link:
    * Text: Click ![icon](../media/newbtn_link.png) in the toolbar, select **Special links** &gt; **Tracked links**, and select a link.
    * Image: In the side-panel (under **Action**), select **Special links** &gt; **Tracked links**, and select a link.
* To create a new tracked link, click **Create new tracked link** at the bottom of the screen. The **Link properties** dialog opens. Follow the procedure in [Create tracked links](Create_links.md).

To view all the links in a mailing, open the mailing in view mode and select the **Tracked links** tab. See [Work with tracked links after the mailing](Work_with_tracked_links_after_the_mailing.md).

> [!TIP]
> You can also add regular (untracked) links. For text links, click the link button ( ![icon](../media/newbtn_link.png) ) in the toolbar. For image links, use the **Image URL** field in the side-panel. f you later decide you want to track these links also, you can select the **Track all links** option under **Tracking** in [Step 1: Setup](step_1_setup_email.md). These links will, however, only be tracked for the mailing in question, and will not be available for other mailings.
