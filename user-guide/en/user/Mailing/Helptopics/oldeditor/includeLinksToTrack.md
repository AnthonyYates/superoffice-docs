# Include links you want to track

[!include[Requirement](../../../includes/req-marketing.md)]

You can include links (URLs) in a message and track them. In other words, you can see how many recipients have clicked them and who has clicked them. Read more about tracking in [Examples of the use of trackable links](../Examples-of-the-use-of-trackable-links.md).

To add tracked links to the e-mail:

1. Go to the contents of the message and edit a paragraph (see [Edit a paragraph](Edit-a-paragraph.md)) to open the **Edit paragraph** screen.
2. Select the **Body** tab.
3. Enter or select the text which the recipient has to click, for example "Click here for more information".
4. Select this text and click the ![icon](../../media/btn-link.png)**Tracked link** button in the toolbar. The **Add link** dialog opens.
5. Do one of the following:
    * Click ![icon](../../media/btn-folder.png)**Choose link** to select an existing tracked link.
    * Start typing in the search field (below the **Choose link** and **New link** buttons) to search for existing tracked links.
    * Click ![icon](../../media/btn-Add.png)**New link** to create a new link. Links that are created using this option, will only be available from this mailing (and copies of this mailing). To create a tracked link that can be used in other mailings as well, go to the **Tracked links** tab(see [Create tracked links](../Create-links.md)).
6. In the **Link label** field, you can edit the link text. Remember to add a space at the end of the text.
7. Click **OK** in the **Add link** dialog once you have finished adding links to the message. This takes you back to the **Edit paragraph** screen. The linked text is blue and underlined.
8. Click **OK**.

To view all the links in a mailing, open the mailing in view mode and select the **Tracked links** tab. See [Work with tracked links after the mailing](../Work-with-tracked-links-after-the-mailing.md).

> [!TIP]
> You can also add regular (untracked) links by clicking the link button ( ![icon](../../media/btn-link.png) ) in the toolbar. If you later decide you want to track these links also, you can select the **Track all links** option under **Tracking** in [Step 1: Setup](../step-1-setup-email.md). These links will, however, only be tracked for the mailing in question, and will not be available for other mailings.
