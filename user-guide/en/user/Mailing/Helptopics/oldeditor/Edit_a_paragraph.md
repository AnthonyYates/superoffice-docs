# Edit a paragraph

To edit a paragraph in a message, do as follows:

1. Go to the **Content** step in the mailing, or open a template for editing.
2. Hover the mouse pointer over the paragraph you wish to edit, so that the paragraph menu is shown.

3. Click the **Edit paragraph** button ( ![icon](../../media/btn_editor_edit.png) ). The editing view opens next to the preview.  
4. In the editing view you can do the following:
    * The **Heading** tab: Here you can edit the heading of the paragraph. You work with text much the same as in MS Word, and the text is saved in HTML format. The program also contains a **Source** button you can click to display and edit the HTML source code directly, but this option should be used with caution.

    * The **Body** tab: Here you can edit the content of the paragraph. The tab has the same functions as the **Heading** tab.

    * > [!TIP]
> If the toolbar is not visible, click ![icon](../../media/btn_editor_toolbar_showhide.png) to show it. The toolbar buttons are described here:  
        <a href="http://docs.cksource.com/CKEditor_3.x/Users_Guide/Quick_Reference" target="_blank">http://docs.cksource.com/CKEditor_3.x/Users_Guide/Quick_Reference</a>

    * The **Image** tab: Here you can add an [image to the paragraph](Insert_images_in_the_message.md).

    * The **Layout** tab: Here you define the properties for displaying the paragraph.
5. Click **Spellcheck** ( ![icon](../../media/btn_spellcheck.jpg) ) on the toolbar in the **Heading** and **Body** tabs and select a language to spellcheck the message in that language.
6. Click **Apply** to view you changes in the preview without closing the editing view .  
    or  
    Click **OK** when you have finished.
