# Step 3: Content - Document

In the **Content** step you can edit the appearance and content of the document.

In order to do this:

1. Click the **Edit** button.
2. Click **Download document** in the dialog box that appears. The file is downloaded to your browser.
3. Open the document for editing. In most browsers you can click the downloaded file to open it in the default application.
4. Edit the contents of the document.
5. Save the document.
6. (if relevant) In SuperOffice Marketing, click **Edit** to reopen the dialog box.
7. Click **Select file**, select the saved document, and click **Upload selected file**. The preview on the right is updated with the contents of the uploaded file.

Click **Next** to go to the next step: [Step 4: Recipients](Step-4-Recipients-Document.md).

## Use template variables

You can use SuperOffice CRM template variables in your document to insert customer-specific information. This will give the message a more personal touch. You can find more information about these template variables [in the SuperOffice CRM Help](../../standardcrm/diary/Template-variables.md).
