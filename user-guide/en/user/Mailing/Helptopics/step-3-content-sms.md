# Step 3: Content - SMS

In the **Content** step you enter the content of the SMS.

In order to do this:

1. In the **SMS text** field, enter the text. You can use [template variables for contacts](../../Service/topics/Template-variables.md#Variables-for-a-selected-contact) here. This works the same way as for e-mail mailings. See [Use template variables in messages](Use-template-variables-in-messages.md).
2. Click **Next** to go to the next step: [Step 4: Recipients](Step-4-Recipients-SMS.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The number of characters (including spaces) is displayed in the **Number of chars** field. The character limit for 1 SMS message is 160 characters. If your message exceeds 160 characters, it will be sent as 2 or more messages.
