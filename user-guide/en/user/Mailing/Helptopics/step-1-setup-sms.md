# Step 1: Setup - SMS

The first step in creating an SMS mailing, is called **Setup**. Here you can set the name of the SMS mailing and the sender, and set archive options for the mailing.

In order to do this:

1. Enter a name in the **Name of mailing** field.
2. In the **From** field, enter the sender name or mobile phone number. If you want the recipients to be able to reply to the SMS, you must enter a phone number.
3. In the **Folder** list, select a folder in which to place the mailing. <!-- Fix reuse ID=a3 -->

1. In the **Selection** and **Project** fields, you can associate the mailing with a selection and/or a project. Start typing in the **Selection** or **Project** fields to search for a selection or project respectively. <!-- Fix reuse ID=a2 -->
    Answer: To keep track of all mailings related to your selections and projects. The mailings are listed in the **Mailings** section tab in **Selections**, and in the **Activities** section tab in **Projects** in SuperOffice CRM.

    Example: If you send out multiple mailings to promote an event, you can add these mailings to a selection called "Event 2015" to have a complete list of all mailings for this event.

    Similarly, if you have created a project for your event, you can maintain a list of all project-related mailings in the **Activities** section tab.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you add a selection or a project, any contacts in the selection or project will be added as recipients in the mailing. If you add both a selection and a project, only contacts from the selection will be added as recipients.
5. Click **Next** to go to the next step: [Step 2: Template](Step-2-Template-SMS.md).
