# Step 1: Setup - SMS

The first step in creating an SMS mailing, is called **Setup**. Here you can set the name of the SMS mailing and the sender, and set archive options for the mailing.

In order to do this:

1. Enter a name in the **Name of mailing** field.
2. In the **From** field, enter the sender name or mobile phone number. If you want the recipients to be able to reply to the SMS, you must enter a phone number.
3. In the **Folder** list, select a folder in which to place the mailing. <!-- Fix reuse ID=a3 -->

4. In the **Selection** and **Project** fields, you can associate the mailing with a selection and/or a project. [!include[Start typing to search](../../includes/type-to-search.md)] <!-- Fix reuse ID=a2 -->
