# Add images

Add images to use in e-mails. See [Insert images in the message](Insert_images_in_the_message.md).

To add an image to SuperOffice Marketing:

1. Select the **Images** tab.
2. Optional: Select a folder or <!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->.
    It is always a good idea to define a well-organised folder structure to get a better overview of your mailings, forms, templates, links and images in SuperOffice Marketing. You can create sub-folders in all folders, and you can place the appropriate mailings, forms, templates, links and images in each of these folders.

    To create a new folder:

    1. Select one of the main tabs in SuperOffice Marketing.
    2. Optional: Open an existing folder to create a sub-folder. You may have to click the **All ...** button first.
    3. Click the ![icon](../media/btn_addfolder.png)**Add folder** button. The **Folder properties** dialog appears.
    4. Enter a descriptive name for the folder in the **Name** field.
    5. Click **OK**. If the folder does not display in the list, click the **My ...** or **All ...** button.
3. Click the ![icon](../media/btn_Add.png)**Add** button. This takes you to the **Image properties** screen.
4. Enter a descriptive name for the image in the **Name** field.
5. Click **Upload files (or drag here)**, select the image to add, and click **Open**.  
    or  
    Drag an image from your PC and drop it on **Upload files (or drag here)**.  
    The preview displays the image.
6. Click **OK** when you are done.
