# Create address list

You can add recipients to a mailing by importing them from an external comma-separated file (for example a .txt file created in Notepad or a .csv file created in Excel).

The import file must have the following format:

* Each recipient must be on its own line (row).

* Each recipient (row) consist of the full name and e-mail address.  
    Example: "John Smith, john@company.com")

* > [!NOTE]
> You can also specify just the e-mail address. The name will then not be available as a template variable.

* ![icon](../../media/OnPremises.png) (requires the Marketing SMS licence) Each recipient (row) can also contain a mobile phone number (after the e-mail address) if you are creating SMS mailings. (For example: "John Smith, john@company.com, 99999999".)

> [!NOTE]
> If you only have the mobile phone number and want to send an SMS, you can enter the following: " , , 99887766".
