# Step 5: Confirm - SMS

In the final step, **Confirm**, you can view a summary of the mailing and verify that these are correct. Any error messages displayed in this screen need to be solved before the mailing can be sent.

**Note**: The send options are disabled if there are incomplete steps or missing information in your mailing. These are indicated in red.

In order not to overload your servers during working hours, it might be a good idea to choose a time during the evening. This option is not available for mailings that have already started, temporarily stopped or have finished.

To do this:

1. Click **Schedule**.
2. Under **Schedule to send at**, select one of the following options:
    * Click the **Choose date** icon ( ![icon](../media/btn_calendar.jpg) ), and select the date and time the mailing is to start.
    * Click **Set to now** ( ![icon](../media/btn_schedulenow.png) ) to insert today's date and the time.
3. Click **OK**. The workflow closes and you are returned to the **Mailings** tab.

## What happens now?

You can click the mailing in the list to view sending status and statistics. See [Track the mailing and view statistics](Track_the_mailing_and_view_statistics.md).

To stop the mailing or start a planned mailing ahead of schedule, click the **Stop** or **Start** button respectively.
