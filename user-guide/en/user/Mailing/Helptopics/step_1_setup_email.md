# Step 1: Setup - E-mail

The first step in creating an e-mail mailing, is called **Setup**. Here you can set the e-mail header information such as sender, reply-to address and subject. You can also add attachments, set archive options for the mailing and select tracking options.

In order to do this:

1. Enter a name in the **Name of mailing** field.
2. Enter the subject of the e-mail in the **E-mail subject** field.
3. In the **From** list, select **Always use** and enter the sender's e-mail address in the field below to use the same sender for all mailings. You can also choose a sales contact or support contact as the sender, if one is defined for this recipient. Enter an e-mail address to be used if no sales contact or support contact is available.
4. In the **Reply to** list, you have the same options as above. In addition, you can select **Use "From" as reply address**. Any replies will then be sent to the sender.
5. In the **Folder** list, select a folder in which to place the mailing. <!-- Fix reuse ID=a3 -->
    It is always a good idea to define a well-organised folder structure to get a better overview of your mailings, forms, templates, links and images in SuperOffice Marketing. You can create sub-folders in all folders, and you can place the appropriate mailings, forms, templates, links and images in each of these folders.

    To create a new folder:

    1. Select one of the main tabs in SuperOffice Marketing.
    2. Optional: Open an existing folder to create a sub-folder. You may have to click the **All ...** button first.
    3. Click the ![icon](../media/btn_addfolder.png)**Add folder** button. The **Folder properties** dialog appears.
    4. Enter a descriptive name for the folder in the **Name** field.
    5. Click **OK**. If the folder does not display in the list, click the **My ...** or **All ...** button.
6. In the **Selection** and **Project** fields, you can associate the mailing with a selection and/or a project. <!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 --> If you add a selection, any contacts in the selection will be added as recipients in the mailing. See [Step 4: Recipients](Step_4__Recipients_email.md).   
    <!-- Fix reuse ID=a2 -->
    Answer: To keep track of all mailings related to your selections and projects. The mailings are listed in the **Mailings** section tab in **Selections**, and in the **Activities** section tab in **Projects** in SuperOffice CRM.

    Example: If you send out multiple mailings to promote an event, you can add these mailings to a selection called "Event 2015" to have a complete list of all mailings for this event.

    Similarly, if you have created a project for your event, you can maintain a list of all project-related mailings in the **Activities** section tab.

    Start typing in the **Selection** or **Project** fields to search for a selection or project respectively.
7. In the **Type** list, select the type of mailing you are creating. Select **(Any)** if the mailing matches two or more of the available types. Use **(Any)** when you have added multiple recipients with multiple subscriptions and you want to send the mailing to all of them.
8. **Attachments**: To add one or more attachments to the mailing, use one of the following methods:
    * Click **Upload files (or drag here)** to browse to and add a file from a disk or server.
    * Drag and drop a file from Windows Explorer to the attachments field.
    * Click **Choose a CRM document** to select a document in SuperOffice CRM.
9. Under **Tracking** are the following options:
    **Track all links**: Select this option to track all links in the mailing. This will also include links that are not registered as tracked links in SuperOffice Marketing, for instance unregistered links from templates or old mailings, or links that are entered directly in the source/HTML code.
    **Use Google Analytics**: Select this option to track the mailing and connect it to Google Analytics (if that is set up for your web site). In the fields below, enter the data that should be added as parameters in the tracked URLs.
    * **Medium**: This field is set to **Email** by default. You cannot edit this field.
    * **Source**: Enter the source of the mailing, such as "superoffice-mailings".4" etc.
    * **Campaign**: Enter the type of mailing, such as "newsletter" or "lead-nurturing", or enter a specific campaign name such as "spring-sale-june-21" or "upgrade-campaign-v9"..
