# Publish forms

When you have created the form and (if relevant) the form response, you can publish the form.

In order to do so:

1. Go to the **Forms** tab.
2. Click the form to open it in view mode.
3. Set the form to **Active** (![icon](../media/btn-form-active.png)) in the header.
4. Go to the **Publish** tab.
5. (optional) Select **Show with pre-filled fields** to add field identifiers to the link/JavaScript. If no field identifiers are added, you have probably not added these IDs to the fields in the form. This option is relevant if you want to pre-fill fields in the forms with existing customer data from SuperOffice. See [Using pre-filled fields in form](form-prefilled.md).
6. On the left side of the screen, select a publishing option for the form:
    * **Direct link**: A direct link to the form.
    * **Embed inline**: A script tag used to add the form on a web page.
    * **Embed as popup**: A button to open the form in a pop-up window on the web page.
    * **Embed as side tab**: A side tab with a button to hide/show the form.
7. Copy the links/tags into a newsletter, website or customer centre to publish it to your customers or prospects.

A notification on the **Form submissions** tab (![icon](../media/btn-form-notification.png)) indicates that you have received form submissions.
