# Create tracked links

> [!NOTE]
> This feature requires the Marketing User licence.

As mentioned under [Include links you want to track](includeLinksToTrack.md), you can track URLs inserted in e-mails. The **Tracked links** tab is used to administrate these trackable links. The links created here will be available when you and other users when you edit the contents of your mailings.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also create new links while editing the content. See [Include links you want to track](includeLinksToTrack.md).

To create a link:

1. Select the **Tracked links** tab.
2. Optional: Select a folder or <!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->.
    It is always a good idea to define a well-organised folder structure to get a better overview of your mailings, forms, templates, links and images in SuperOffice Marketing. You can create sub-folders in all folders, and you can place the appropriate mailings, forms, templates, links and images in each of these folders.

    To create a new folder:

    1. Select one of the main tabs in SuperOffice Marketing.
    2. Optional: Open an existing folder to create a sub-folder. You may have to click the **All ...** button first.
    3. Click the ![icon](../media/btn-addfolder.png)**Add folder** button. The **Folder properties** dialog appears.
    4. Enter a descriptive name for the folder in the **Name** field.
    5. Click **OK**. If the folder does not display in the list, click the **My ...** or **All ...** button.
3. Click the ![icon](../media/btn-Add.png)**Add** button. This takes you to the **Link properties** screen.
4. Enter a descriptive name for the link in the **Name** field.
5. Under **Link actions** at the bottom of the screen, you can choose what should happen when the recipient clicks the link in the message. See [Define link actions](Define-link-actions.md).
6. Click **OK** when you are done.

A small dot on the link action tabs indicate which link actions are active. Multiple link actions can be active for a link.
