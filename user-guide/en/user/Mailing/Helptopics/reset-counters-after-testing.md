# Reset counters after testing

When you have sent a test mailing, you need to reset the counters for the link(s) in the message. Otherwise, the list will display both your own and others' clicking of links done during testing.

In order to do this:

1. Go to the links **Tracked links** tab
2. Click the menu button ( ![icon](../media/btn_Menu.png) ) next to the relevant link and select **Reset**. The **Clicks** column is set to **0**. Data about which customers have clicked the link are also removed.
