# Google Analytics

When setting up a mailing, you have the option of using Google Analytics as the tracking system. The setup in mailings allows you to define a more accurate tracking of e-mails using the provided fields, which results in more detailed Google Channel reports.

**Medium**: “Email” is the pre-defined medium in automated UTM tags. This means that tracked links in mailings sent from SuperOffice can be found in Google Channel reports under “Emails” (as opposed to “other”).

**Source** and **Campaign**: These fields identify this specific mailing as the source, and allows for a more accurate tracking and reporting in Google.
