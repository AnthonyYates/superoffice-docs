# Filter recipient list

By default all filters are active to show all recipients. Uncheck a filter checkbox to deactivate the filter. Several filters can be combined.

**Sent**: Activate this filter to show all recipients the mailing was sent to.

**Bounced**: Activate this filter to show all recipients for whom the mailing has been returned undelivered. This may be due to e-mail address errors, spam filters, Internet problems or inboxes being full. Some of these problems may be temporary (delivery delays, e-mail server temporarily unavailable etc.), while others are permanent (wrong address, unknown domain etc.). In the latter case, you should add the recipients to a new selection and try to find the cause of the problem.

**Read by recipient**: Activate this filter to show all recipients who have opened/read the mailing.

**Ready to send**: Activate this filter to show all recipients to whom the mailing has not been sent yet.

**Blocked**: Activate this filter to show the following recipients:

* Recipient who have not given their consent to being contacted.
* Duplicate recipients.
* Recipients without a subscription.

**Recipient complained**: Activate this filter to show recipients who have reported the mailing as spam/junk mail.

If the status is **Ready to send**, you do not have to do anything. SuperOffice will send your mailing to the recipients. The status will be changed to **Sent** once this is done.
