# Step 4: Recipients - Document

In the fourth step, **Recipients**, you must select the recipients of the mailing. You can add recipients from a number of sources, as described below. In addition, you can set various mailing options here and also preview the mailing.

## Add recipients from selections and projects

You can add recipients from selections (from both SuperOffice CRM and SuperOffice Service) and projects (from SuperOffice CRM).

To do this:

1. Under **Add recipients**, click **Selection** or **Project**.
2. Click in the field below and start typing the name of the selection or project you want to add. As you type, a dynamic list displays the matches.
3. Click a selection or a project in the list.
4. Click ![icon](../media/btn_Add.png). The selection or project is added to the **Recipient sources** list, and the **Recipients** list is updated.
5. Repeat steps 1 through 4 to add more selections or projects.

> [!NOTE]
> If you selected a selection under **Archive mailing** in **Setup** (step 1), this selection is listed under **Recipient sources**. You can delete this selection if necessary.

## Add contacts from SuperOffice

You can add individual contacts from SuperOffice. To do this:

1. Under **Add recipients**, click **Contact**.
2. Click in the field below and start typing the name of the contact you want to add, in the field below. You can also enter a company name to display all contacts for a company.
3. Select the contact you want from the list that appears.
4. Click ![icon](../media/btn_Add.png). The contact is added to the **Recipient sources** list, and the **Recipients** list is updated.
5. Repeat steps 2-5 to add more contacts. Additional contacts will be added to the same row in the **Recipient sources** list, and the number of contacts will display in the **Name** column.

## Recipient options

Under **Options** in the lower part of the **Recipients** screen, you can select various alternatives for the mailing:

* **Override consent and subscription**: Select this option to also send the mailing to contacts who have not given their consent to receiving e-marketing or are not subscribing to this mailing type. These contacts are listed with the status **No consent** in the **Recipients** list.

* **Include companies**: Select this option to include companies as recipients.

* **Prefer company**: Select this option to send the mailing only to the companies in the recipient list (and not the related contacts). Each company will only receive one mailing. Contacts that do not belong to a company, will still receive the mailing.  
    The **Prefer company** option is only available if you have selected **Include companies** above.

## Review and update the Recipients list

When you add selections, projects, contacts and import lists, the **Recipients** list is automatically updated. If you have checked the option **Update recipient list when sending**, the projects and selections will be checked before sending the mailing, in case contacts have been added, removed or edited.

In addition, you can click the **Update list** button below the **Recipients** list to update the list manually. You should do this if it's been a while since you added the recipients. Some of the contacts on the list might have changed their consent in the mean time.

> [!NOTE]
> The list only displays the first 50 recipients. Click **Load all** at the bottom of the list to display all recipients.

Click **Next** to go to [Step 5: Confirm](Step_5__Confirm_-_Document.md). You can still revisit the **Recipients** step to edit the recipients list.

> [!TIP]
> Click the **Save + close** button to save the mailing and close it. You can continue working on the mailing later.
