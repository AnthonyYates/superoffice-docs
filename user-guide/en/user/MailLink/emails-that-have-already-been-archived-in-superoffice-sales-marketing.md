# E-mails that have already been archived in SuperOffice CRM

When an e-mail is archived by a user, it is tagged with a unique ID within SuperOffice CRM. This means that next time someone tries to archive the same e-mail, a warning will appear informing them about this; in this way, it is possible to avoid duplicates in the database.

If you open an e-mail that has already been archived, the **Archive e-mail** button ![icon](media//Already-archived.png) will appear green with a white check-mark. If you hold the mouse pointer over the button, an info box is displayed, telling you when and by whom the e-mail was archived. This presupposes that you have selected the **Check for duplicates when an e-mail is opened** option in the **SuperOffice CRM options** dialog (see [General settings](Other-options.md)).
