# General settings

These options appear in the **General settings** pane of the **SuperOffice CRM options** dialog (see [SuperOffice CRM options dialog](email-options-dialog.md)).

**Actions when archiving an e-mail:**

These options determine how SuperOffice CRM and the mail client behave in response to various operations.

**Close e-mail after archiving to SuperOffice CRM:**

Check this box if you want the e-mail window in the mail client to close automatically after you have archived the e-mail to SuperOffice CRM.

Delete the e-mail after it has been archived to SuperOffice CRM

Check this box if you want to remove the selected e-mails from the mail client inbox after they have been archived in SuperOffice CRM. The e-mails will be moved to the **Deleted items** folder. Please note that if the sender of the e-mail is not listed as a company/contact in SuperOffice CRM, the e-mail(s) will still be moved to the **Deleted items** folder.

Settings for new e-mails:

These options are used for selecting which e-mail body to use.

Use SuperOffice e-mail body

You can predefine an e-mail body that uses data from SuperOffice CRM. In order to use this template, you need to select this option.

Use default body from e-mail client

If you would like to use the default body from the mail client, you may select this option.

**Warnings:**

These options determine when you receive warnings.

Warn me when an e-mail is larger than (in KB):

If you check this box, you will receive a warning whenever you try to archive an e-mail or attachment larger than a given size. Enter the size (in KB) in the field to the right.

Check for duplicates when an e-mail is opened

If you check this box and open an e-mail that has already been archived, the **Archive e-mail** button will appear green with a white check-mark. If you hold the mouse pointer over the button, an info box is displayed, telling you when and by whom the e-mail was archived. (See [E-mails that have already been archived in SuperOffice CRM](emails-that-have-already-been-archived-in-SuperOffice-Sales-Marketing.md).)
