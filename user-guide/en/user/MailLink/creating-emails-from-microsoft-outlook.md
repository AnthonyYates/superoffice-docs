# Creating e-mails from Microsoft Outlook

There are basically two ways of creating an e-mail from Microsoft Outlook. You can use SuperOffice templates (see [Creating e-mails from Microsoft Outlook using SuperOffice templates](Creating-emails-from-Microsoft-Outlook-using-SuperOffice-templates.md)), or you can use standard Outlook functionality. Follow these steps:

1. Click the ****New** e-mail** button on the Microsoft Outlook toolbar. A new e-mail window opens.

2. In the **To** field, enter the e-mail address(es) of the recipient(s). You can also use the **Select recipients** dialog (see [Selecting recipients](Selecting-recipients.md)).

3. Write the message.

4. Add any attachments you would like to include. You can also add documents from SuperOffice CRM (see [Adding documents from SuperOffice CRM as attachments](Adding-documents-from-SuperOffice-Sales-Marketing-as-attachments.md)).

5. Click **Send** to send the message to the specified recipient(s).
