# Not adding an e-mail address to SuperOffice

It is perfectly possible to archive an e-mail/attachment (see [Archiving e-mails on companies/contacts](Archiving-emails-on-companies-contacts-in-SuperOffice-Sales-Marketing.md) and [Archiving attachment(s)](Archiving-attachment-s-to-SuperOffice-Sales-Marketing.md)) or search for a sender (see [Searching for the sender of an e-mail](Searching-for-the-sender-of-an-e-mail.md)) without adding the e-mail address to SuperOffice CRM.

If the sender of the e-mail or attachment is not listed in SuperOffice CRM, a warning will appear at the top of the **Archive e-mail** dialog: **This sender's e-mail address is not recognised. Click here to update SuperOffice with this e-mail address**. If you do not want to add the e-mail address to SuperOffice CRM, simply do not click the warning.
