# Archiving e-mails on companies/contacts

It is possible to archive an e-mail (including any attachments) in your mail client inbox on a company/contact in SuperOffice CRM. This is a convenient way of storing information you have received via e-mail together with other company/contact information in SuperOffice CRM.

Follow these steps:

1. Select the e-mail(s) you would like to archive.

2. Click the **Archive e-mail** button on the toolbar, and **Archive e-mail** from the dropdown. If you have selected more than one e-mail, the procedure below is repeated for each e-mail.

3. If the sender of the e-mail is not listed in SuperOffice CRM, a warning will appear at the top of the dialog for archiving e-mail: **This sender's e-mail address is not recognised. Click here to update SuperOffice with this e-mail address**. See [Handling e-mails from senders not listed in SuperOffice CRM](Handling-emails-from-senders-not-listed-in-SuperOffice-Sales-Marketing.md) for information on how to handle unlisted senders.

4. In the **Subject** field, the subject from the e-mail is automatically inserted. However, you may enter any subject text that you would like to be shown in the **Activities** section tab of SuperOffice CRM.

5. In the **Company** field, which is mandatory, you may search for a company by starting to type the company name and then select from the matches that appear.

6. In the **Contact** field, you may use the dropdown to select one of the contacts belonging to the company you selected in the previous step. You can also search by starting to type the contact name.

7. If you would like to archive the e-mail to a certain project, you may select the project in the **Project** field.

8. If you would like to archive the e-mail to a certain sale, you may select the sale in the **Sale** field.

9. In the **Type** dropdown, you may select one of the available document types.

10. In the **Visible for** field, click the arrow next to the field. A list is displayed allowing you to choose whether the document will be visible to all users, private (i.e. visible only to the user defined as owner) or visible to all users in the user group that the owner belongs to.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Visible for** field is only available if this right has been assigned to you in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.

11. Outlook only: Check the **Remove from inbox** box if you would like to remove the e-mail from the inbox and move it to the **Deleted items** folder in the mail client after it has been successfully archived in SuperOffice CRM.

12. Check the **Include attachments** box if you would like to archive the e-mail including attachments. If you uncheck this option, the e-mail will be saved without any attachments.

13. Click **OK**. The selected e-mail(s) and any attachments are archived to SuperOffice CRM as new documents. You can then double-click any of these documents in the **Activities** section tab to open the e-mail in your mail client.
