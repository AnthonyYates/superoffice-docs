# Creating e-mails using predefined e-mail body templates

When creating an e-mail from SuperOffice CRM, it is also possible to use predefined SuperOffice templates just for the mail body. Follow these steps:

1. Make sure that an e-mail body template is available, and that the **Use SuperOffice e-mail body** option in the **SuperOffice CRM options** dialog is selected (see [General settings](Other-options.md)).

2. Click the **E-mail** toolbar button at the bottom of the SuperOffice CRM window. (This also applies if you click an e-mail address in SuperOffice CRM, send an e-mail from the **Contacts** section tab, or reply to/forward an e-mail from the **Activities** section tab.)

3. In the **To** field, enter the e-mail address(es) of the recipient(s). You can also use the **Select recipients** dialog (see [Selecting recipients](Selecting-recipients.md)).

    > [!TIP]
    > If you select several contacts in a list in SuperOffice CRM, and then right-click and select **Send e-mail**, all the contacts are set as recipients of the e-mail.

4. Write the message.

5. Add any attachments you would like to include. You can also add documents from SuperOffice CRM (see [Adding documents from SuperOffice CRM as attachments](Adding-documents-from-SuperOffice-Sales-Marketing-as-attachments.md)).

6. Click **Send** to send the message to the specified recipient(s).
