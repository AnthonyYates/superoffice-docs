# Archiving e-mails as requests

It is possible to archive an e-mail in your mail client inbox as a request in SuperOffice Service. How this works, depends on whether you are adding the e-mail to a new or existing request. Click the following links to find out more:

## Creating a new request

1. Select the e-mail(s) you would like to archive. If you select more than one e-mail, the procedure below is repeated for each e-mail.
2. Click the **Archive e-mail** button on the toolbar, and **Create request** from the dropdown.
3. In the **Archive as request** dialog, select **Create a new request**.
4. In the **Place request in this queue** field, select the request queue to which you would like to send the request. Each queue has a specific category and priority assigned to it.
5. Check the **Remove from inbox** box if you would like to remove the e-mail from the inbox and move it to the **Deleted items** folder in your mail client after it has been successfully archived in SuperOffice Service.
6. Click **OK**. A message appears to confirm that the request has been created. If the sender's e-mail address is recognised, the request is automatically archived to the correct contact and company. If the sender's e-mail address is not recognised, the sender is automatically registered as a new contact in SuperOffice Service.
7. In the confirmation message, you may select **Click here to open request** if you would like to have a closer look at the request, or **Close** to close the confirmation message.

## Adding a message to an existing request

1. Select the e-mail(s) you would like to archive. If you select more than one e-mail, the procedure below is repeated for each e-mail.
2. Click the **Archive e-mail** button on the toolbar, and **Create request** from the dropdown.
3. In the **Archive as request** dialog, select **Add message to existing request**.
4. In the search field, type the ID or the beginning of the title of the request.
5. Press **ENTER** or click the button with the magnifying glass to start the search. The requests matching your search criteria appear in the **Select request to add this message to** field.
6. Select the request to which you would like to add the e-mail.
7. Check the **Remove from inbox** box if you would like to remove the e-mail from the inbox and move it to the **Deleted items** folder in your mail client after it has been successfully archived in SuperOffice Service.
8. Click **OK**. A message appears to confirm that the request has been updated. If the request had been closed earlier, it is now reactivated.
9. In the confirmation message, you may select **Click here to open request** if you would like to have a closer look at the request, or **Close** to close the confirmation message.
