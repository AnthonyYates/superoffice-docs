# Searching for the sender of an e-mail

You can use the ****Search for sender**** button to search for a sender in SuperOffice CRM or SuperOffice Service. This option searches your preferred SuperOffice client for the precise e-mail address of the sender. (See [SuperOffice account](SuperOffice-Account.md) for information about how to select your preferred SuperOffice client.)

Follow these steps:

1. Select the e-mail in the mail client inbox (you can select only one) whose sender you'd like to search for in your SuperOffice client.
2. Click the ****Search for sender**** button.
3. What happens next, depends on whether the sender is found or not found in your SuperOffice client:
    * If the e-mail address is found on a company/contact, the company/contact opens in your SuperOffice client.
    * If the e-mail address is registered on more than one company/contact, a dialog will appear, listing the alternatives and allowing you to choose one of them.
    * If the e-mail address is not registered in your SuperOffice client, you will be given the possibility of adding it.
    * SuperOffice CRM only: If the sender of the selected e-mail is marked as a former employee, the company/contact will still open, but the sender is not shown in SuperOffice CRM unless you have chosen to show former employees.
