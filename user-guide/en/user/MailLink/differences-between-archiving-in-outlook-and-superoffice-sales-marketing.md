# Differences between archiving in Outlook, Notes and SuperOffice CRM

You can create e-mails in several different ways, both from Outlook (see [Creating e-mails from Microsoft Outlook](Creating-emails-from-Microsoft-Outlook.md)), from Notes (see [Creating e-mails from Lotus Notes](Creating-emails-from-Lotus-Notes.md)) and from SuperOffice CRM (see [Creating e-mails from SuperOffice CRM](Creating-emails-from-SuperOffice-Sales-Marketing.md)). If the **Document** dialog appears, the e-mail will be treated as a SuperOffice document and be archived. If the **Document** dialog does not appear, then whether the e-mail is archived or not depends on the settings in the **SuperOffice CRM options** dialog. This is explained in more detail below.

The **Document** dialog will open automatically if you:

* Click the **Write** button in SuperOffice CRM.

* Click the down arrow to the right of the ****New** e-mail** button on the Microsoft Outlook toolbar and select one of the templates on the **SuperOffice message** submenu.

The **Document** dialog will not open automatically if you:

* Click the ****New** e-mail** button in the mail client. The e-mails will, however, be archived if the **Archive e-mail by default when: created from e-mail client** option in the **SuperOffice CRM options** dialog is selected (see [Archive options](Default-options.md)).

* Click the **E-mail** button in SuperOffice CRM. The e-mails will, however, be archived if the **Archive e-mail by default when: created from SuperOffice CRM** option in the **SuperOffice CRM options** dialog is selected (see [Archive options](Default-options.md)).

* When you create an e-mail using the **E-mail** button in SuperOffice CRM, it is possible to use a predefined e-mail body template by default if the **Use SuperOffice e-mail body** option in the **SuperOffice CRM options** dialog is selected (see [General settings](Other-options.md)). You can read more about this in [Creating e-mails using predefined e-mail body templates](Creating-emails-using-predefined-email-body-templates.md).

> [!NOTE]
> This also applies if you click an e-mail address in SuperOffice CRM, send an e-mail from the **Contacts** section tab, or reply to/forward an e-mail from the **Activities** section tab.
