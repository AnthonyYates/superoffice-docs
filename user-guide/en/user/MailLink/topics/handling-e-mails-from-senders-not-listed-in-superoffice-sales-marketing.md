# Handling e-mails from senders not listed in SuperOffice

When you archive an e-mail or an attachment, SuperOffice CRM performs a search to see if the sender matches any of the recorded companies or contacts. If the sender is not listed in SuperOffice CRM at all, you will be given the option of adding their e-mail address to SuperOffice CRM.

Follow these steps:

1. Archive the e-mail or attachment as described in one of these topics:
    * [Archiving e-mails on companies/contacts](Archiving-e-mails-on-companies-contacts-in-SuperOffice-Sales-Marketing.md)
    * [Archiving e-mails as activities](Archiving-e-mails-as-tasks-in-SuperOffice-Sales-Marketing.md)
    * [Archiving attachments](Archiving-attachment-s-to-SuperOffice-Sales-Marketing.md)
2. If the sender of the e-mail or attachment is not listed in SuperOffice CRM, a warning will appear at the top of the dialog for archiving e-mail when you attempt to archive: **This sender's e-mail address is not recognised. Click here to update SuperOffice with this e-mail address**. Click the warning.
3. In the **Save e-mail address** dialog, select one of the following radio buttons:
    * **Create new contact**: Click this option if you want to add the e-mail address to a new contact. See [Adding an e-mail address to a new contact](Adding-an-e-mail-address-to-a-new-contact.md).
    * **Add e-mail address to existing contact**: Click this option if you want to add the e-mail address to an existing contact. See [Adding an e-mail address to an existing contact](Adding-an-e-mail-address-to-an-existing-contact.md).
4. Click **OK**. The contact and their e-mail address will be displayed on the **Contacts** section tab of the specified company card.

> [!NOTE]
> If you attempt to archive more than one e-mail at a time, you will be prompted for each sender not listed in SuperOffice CRM.
