# SuperOffice Mail Link

SuperOffice Mail Link is a plug-in which links the Microsoft Outlook or Lotus Notes mail client with SuperOffice CRM and/or SuperOffice Service. This means that among other things, you can:

* Archive e-mails and attachments to SuperOffice CRM.
* Archive an e-mail as a document or a task in SuperOffice CRM.
* Archive an e-mail as a request in SuperOffice Service.
* Search for the sender of an e-mail.
* Set functions for default archiving.
* Use SuperOffice templates or predefined e-mail body templates when creating e-mails.
* Update the information about companies and contacts in SuperOffice CRM based on e-mails you receive.
