# Creating e-mails from Microsoft Outlook using SuperOffice templates

When creating an e-mail from Microsoft Outlook, it is also possible to use SuperOffice templates. Follow these steps:

1. Click the down arrow to the right of the ****New** e-mail** button on the Microsoft Outlook toolbar. A menu is displayed.

2. Click **SuperOffice message** and select one of the templates on this submenu. The **New SuperOffice e-mail** dialog opens.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This presupposes that you are logged on to SuperOffice CRM. If not, the menu will only contain one item: **Populate**. If you click **Populate**, you will be asked if you want to start SuperOffice CRM. If you accept, the submenu will be populated.

3. In the **Subject** field, enter the text that you would like to be the subject of the e-mail. This will also be shown in the Activities section tab of SuperOffice CRM.

4. In the Company field, you may search for a company by starting to type the company name and then select from the matches that appear.

5. In the Contact field, you may use the dropdown to select one of the contacts belonging to the company you selected in the previous step. You can also search by starting to type the contact name.

6. If you would like to link the e-mail to a certain project, you may select the project in the Project field.

7. If you would like to link the e-mail to a certain sale, you may select the sale in the Sale field.

8. In the Type dropdown, you may select one of the available e-mail templates.

9. In the **Visible for** field, click the arrow next to the field. A list is displayed allowing you to choose whether the document will be visible to all users, private (i.e. visible only to the user defined as owner) or visible to all users in the user group that the owner belongs to.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Visible for** field is only available if this right has been assigned to you in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.

10. Click **OK** in the **New SuperOffice e-mail** dialog. A new e-mail window opens.

11. In the **To** field, enter the e-mail address of any other recipients you would like to add. You can also use the **Select recipients** dialog (see [Selecting recipients](Selecting-recipients.md)).

12. Write the message.

13. Add any attachments you would like to include. You can also add documents from SuperOffice CRM (see [Adding documents from SuperOffice CRM as attachments](Adding-documents-from-SuperOffice-Sales-Marketing-as-attachments.md)).

14. Click **Send** to send the message to the specified recipient(s).
