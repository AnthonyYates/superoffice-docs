# Adding documents from SuperOffice CRM as attachments

When creating an e-mail (see [Creating e-mails from Microsoft Outlook](Creating-e-mails-from-Microsoft-Outlook.md) or [Creating e-mails from Lotus Notes](Creating-e-mails-from-Lotus-Notes.md)) you can add documents from SuperOffice CRM as attachments. Follow these steps:

1. In the e-mail window, click the **Attach document** button (![icon](../media/Add-document.png)). The **Include attachments** dialog opens.

2. Under **Select from**, select one of the six radio buttons: **Company**, **Project**, **Sale**, **Selection**, **Author** or **Template**. The rest of the dialog changes accordingly.

3. Go to the dropdown directly below the radio buttons. What you may do here, depends on what you selected in the previous step:

    * If you selected **Company**, **Project**, **Sale** or **Selection** in the previous step, select the name of a company/project/sale/selection in the dropdown. You can also search by starting to type the name of the item in question.
    * If you selected **Author**, you may search for the author of the document by starting to type the person's name in the dropdown and then select from the matches that appear.
    * If you selected **Template**, you may select a template from the dropdown.

4. From the **Date range** dropdown, select the period in which the document(s) you are looking for was/were created.

5. In the list on the left-hand side, all the documents that meet the criteria you have entered, are shown. Select a document and click the arrow button between the lists ( ![icon](../media/Arrow.png) ) to move it to the list on the right-hand side of the dialog.

6. Repeat step 5 if you would like to include more documents.

7. When you have finished selecting documents, click **OK** to attach them to your e-mail.
