# Handling e-mails from senders with several listings

When you archive an e-mail or an attachment, SuperOffice CRM performs a search to see if the sender matches any of the recorded companies or contacts. If the sender is listed more than once in SuperOffice CRM, a dialog will appear informing you of this and allowing you to select the correct entry.
