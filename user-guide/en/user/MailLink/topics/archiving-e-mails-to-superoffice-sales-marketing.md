# Archiving e-mails to SuperOffice

When you click the **Archive e-mail** button on the mail client toolbar, a menu with archiving options is displayed. These are described in the following topics:

* [Archiving e-mails on companies/contacts](Archiving_e-mails_on_companies_contacts_in_SuperOffice_Sales_Marketing.md)
* [Archiving e-mails as activities](Archiving_e-mails_as_tasks_in_SuperOffice_Sales_Marketing.md)
* [Archiving attachments](Archiving_attachment_s_to_SuperOffice_Sales_Marketing.md)
* [Archiving e-mails as requests](Archiving_e-mails_as_requests.md)

**Note:** This button also appears in the e-mail window when you open an e-mail you have received.

For all the different archiving options, you may select the **Warn me when an e-mail is larger than (in KB)** option in the **General settings** pane of the **SuperOffice CRM options** dialog (see [General settings](Other_options.md)). Thus, when you try to archive an e-mail containing an attachment that is over the specified limit, a dialog will inform you of this and ask you if you would like to archive it anyway.
