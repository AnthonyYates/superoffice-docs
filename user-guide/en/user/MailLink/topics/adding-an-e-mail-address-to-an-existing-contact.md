# Adding an e-mail address to an existing contact

Follow these steps:

1. Open the **Save e-mail address** dialog. See [Handling e-mails from senders not listed in SuperOffice CRM](Handling_e-mails_from_senders_not_listed_in_SuperOffice_Sales_Marketing.md) or [Searching for the sender of an e-mail](Searching_for_the_sender_of_an_e-mail.md).
2. Select the **Add e-mail address to existing contact** option.
3. In the **Company** field, select the company you want to register the e-mail address under. You may search for a company by starting to type the company name and then select from the matches that appear.
4. In the **Contact** field, choose from the contacts recorded for the active company.
5. Check the **Set as primary e-mail address for this contact** box if the contact has more than one e-mail address and you would like this one to be used as his or her default address.
6. Click **OK**. The contact and their e-mail address will be displayed on the **Contacts** section tab of the specified company card.
