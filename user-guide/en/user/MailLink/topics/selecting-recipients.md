# Selecting recipients

When creating an e-mail (see [Creating e-mails from Microsoft Outlook][1] or [Creating e-mails from Lotus Notes][2]), you can add recipients using the **Select recipients** dialog. Follow these steps:

1. In the new e-mail window, click the **Add recipient** button (![icon][img1]). The **Select recipients** dialog opens.

2. Under **Select from**, select one of the five radio buttons: **Company**, **Project**, **Sale**, **Selection** or **User group**. The rest of the dialog changes accordingly.

3. Select the name of a company/project/sale/selection/user group. You can also search by starting to type the name of the item in question.

    A list of all the members of the selected company/project/sale/selection/user group is displayed. If an employee has got more than one e-mail address and you select **Show all addresses** in the lower left corner of the dialog, all his or her e-mail addresses will be shown.

4. Select the recipients to include in the **To** field and click the arrow button to the right of the list (![icon][img2]). The recipients are displayed in the **To** list on the right-hand side of the window.

5. Select the recipients to include in the **Cc** field and click the arrow button to the right of the list (![icon][img2]). The recipients are displayed in the **Cc** list on the right-hand side of the window.

6. Select the recipients to include in the **Bcc** field and click the arrow button to the right of the list (![icon][img2]). The recipients are displayed in the **Bcc** list on the right-hand side of the window.

7. When you have finished selecting recipients, click **OK** to enter them as recipients in your e-mail.
