# Turning default archiving on/off

If you want to archive all e-mails you send from your mail client in SuperOffice CRM, you can enable the archive by default function by selecting from the options under **Archive e-mail by default when:** in the **SuperOffice CRM** **options** dialog. (See [Archive options](Default-options.md).) All e-mails you send will then be archived to SuperOffice CRM by default.

Click the **Archive is ON/OFF** button in the new e-mail window to enable/disable the archive by default function for e-mails created in your mail client.
