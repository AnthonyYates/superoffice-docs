# Creating e-mails from SuperOffice CRM

There are basically two ways of creating an e-mail from SuperOffice CRM. You can use the **E-mail** toolbar button at the bottom of the SuperOffice CRM window. This works more or less the same way as described in [Creating e-mails from Microsoft Outlook](Creating-e-mails-from-Microsoft-Outlook.md) or [Creating e-mails from Lotus Notes](Creating-e-mails-from-Lotus-Notes.md), apart from the fact that you can use predefined e-mail body templates (see [Creating e-mails using predefined e-mail body templates](Creating-e-mails-using-predefined-e-mail-body-templates.md)).

You can, however, also use the **Write** toolbar button. Follow these steps:

1. Click the **Write** toolbar button at the bottom of the SuperOffice CRM window. The **Document** dialog opens.
2. In the **Type** field at the top of the dialog, select an e-mail template.
3. Complete the remaining fields with the required information. Please refer to the User's Guide for more information on this dialog.
4. Click the **Create** button to open the new e-mail in your default mail client.
5. If SuperOffice CRM contains an e-mail address for the company/contact you have chosen in the **Document** dialog, this address is inserted automatically in the messageâ€™s **To** field.  
    Enter the e-mail addresses of any other recipients you would like to add. You can also use the **Select recipients** dialog (see [Selecting recipients](Selecting-recipients.md)).
6. Write the message.
7. Add any attachments you would like to include. You can also add documents from SuperOffice CRM (see [Adding documents from SuperOffice CRM as attachments](Adding-documents-from-SuperOffice-Sales-Marketing-as-attachments.md)).
8. Click **Send** to send the message to the specified recipient(s).
