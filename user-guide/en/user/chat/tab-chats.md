# The Chats tab

Use the **Chats** tab to respond to incoming chats from customers.

![icon][img1] The number in the **Chats** tab indicates the number of chats you are currently handling.

The **Chats** tab has three main areas:

* List of active/recent chat sessions (left side)
* Chat conversation (middle)
* Contact side panel (right side) â†’ showing customer information

## List of active/recent chat sessions

This list contains

* ongoing chats
* recently completed chats (last 8 hours)

The number of chats in queue is also listed here, and you can click **Get next in queue** to respond to the next chat in the queue.

The following icons are used for the active chat sessions in the list:

| Icon | Description |
|---|---|
| ![icon][img2] | The last message in the conversation from the customer and agent. |
| ![icon][img3] | Number of unread messages from the customer. |
| ![icon][img4] | Transferred chat to you or from you. Waiting to be accepted. |

## Chat conversation

Here you can chat with the customer. See [Respond to a chat][1].

## Contact side panel (right side)

When a customer contacts you in the chat and is already registered in SuperOffice, you can display relevant information about them in the side panel on the right side of the **Chat** screen. You can also add new customers as new contacts (and new companies). See [The contact side panel][2].
