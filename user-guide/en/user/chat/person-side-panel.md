# The contact side panel

The contact side panel is located on the right side of the **Chat** screen. Here you can match the customer in the chat with an existing contact in SuperOffice, or create a new contact and/or company.

If the customer is found in SuperOffice, you can show contact information, requests, sales, follow-ups and previous chat sessions that have been registered for this contact in SuperOffice.
