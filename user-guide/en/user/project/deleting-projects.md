# Delete projects

To delete a whole project and associated data:

1. [!include[Go to project](includes/goto-project.md)]
2. Click the **Task** button (![icon][img1]).
3. Select **Delete 'project name'**.
4. When you are asked if you really want to delete the project, click **Yes**. (For more details about this, see [Delete items in SuperOffice CRM][1].)
