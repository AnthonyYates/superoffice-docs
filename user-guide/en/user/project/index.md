# Project

Using the **Project** function, you can link any activities both to an external company and to the project. You can also work using a project guide that takes you through each step of the project, assuming a project guide has been created for the project type you have selected. A project can be targeted at many contacts, and a contact can participate in many projects.

In the **Project** screen, each project is displayed like an index card. You can see all the information that has been entered for a project.

To move backwards and forwards between projects, click the previous/next buttons ( ![icon][img2] ![icon][img1] ) at the bottom right of the cards

You can also:

* enter, edit and delete projects
* merge projects
* add project members
* link activities to a project
* link projects to a sale
* perform projects using a project guide

If you have selected a project type for which a project guide has been defined, the **Project guide** tab is displayed on the section tab. For more information, see [Project guide][1].
