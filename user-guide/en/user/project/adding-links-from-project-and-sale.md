# Add links from the Project screen

You can add links to activities or websites that are relevant to the project. For example, if you are going to a meeting with a company you have previously communicated with, you can add links to documents and sales you have already created for this company.

## Open links

You can open links by clicking on them in the **Links** tab. URLs/websites open in a new window.

## Remove links

If you want to remove a link, go to the **Links** tab, click **Edit**, click the delete button next to the link. The link will be deleted from the tab.
