# The Navigator

You move between the main sections of SuperOffice CRM using the Navigator, which is on the far left of the main screen.

> [!TIP]
> Clicking the word next to the button gives you access to various options, such as favorites list, history list and search. If you hold the mouse pointer over a record in any the lists, a tooltip is displayed containing additional data about the record.
