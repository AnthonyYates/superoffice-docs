# Key functions in SuperOffice CRM

SuperOffice CRM consists of the following main sections which you will quickly become familiar with:

* [Dashboard][7]
* [Company][8]
* [Contact][9]
* [Diary][10]
* [Sale][11]
  * [Quote][12]
* [Project][13]
* [Selection][14]
* [Inbox][15]
* [Chat][16]
* [Reports][17]
* [Marketing][18]

You can easily switch between these screens by clicking the buttons in the Navigator (see [The Navigator][1]).

Access to other useful functions is also just a click away thanks to the **New** button (see [The Top bar][2]) and the global buttons (see [Global buttons][3]) in SuperOffice CRM.
