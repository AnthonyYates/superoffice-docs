# Log in

When you start SuperOffice CRM, you will see a login screen where you must enter a user ID and password to open the program. These are defined in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance. For online and web users the user ID is your e-mail address. Windows users must use their assigned user name.

1. Enter your user ID and password.
2. Click **Log in**.

Wait a moment while the program starts up.

<!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->

Online:

1. Click the **Forgot your password?** link.
2. Enter you e-mail address.
3. Click **Reset Password**.

You will receive an e-mail that allows you to change your password.

Onsite users: Contact your SuperOffice administrator to receive a new password.
