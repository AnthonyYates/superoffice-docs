# Archive outgoing e-mail

When you send an e-mail, you can also archive it (including any attachments) as a document in SuperOffice CRM. This is a convenient way of keeping track of your outgoing correspondence.

Follow these steps:

1. In Gmail, click **Compose**.

2. Write the e-mail message.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you send the e-mail to multiple recipients, the e-mail is only archived on the first recipient.

3. Click **Send and archive**. The e-mail is sent and the dialog **Archive e-mail in SuperOffice** opens.

    If the recipient of the e-mail is not listed in SuperOffice CRM, a warning will appear at the top of the dialog. See [Handling e-mails from senders not registered in SuperOffice](Handling-emails-from-senders-not-listed-in-SuperOffice.md). A warning also appears if the recipient is registered on multiple companies in SuperOffice CRM. See [Handling e-mails from senders with several listings](Handling-emails-from-senders-with-several-listings.md).

4. In the dialog **Archive e-mail in SuperOffice**, the **Company** and **Contact** fields have been filled in if the recipient's e-mail address is registered in SuperOffice. Fill in relevant information in the following fields:

    [!include[Archiving options for Gmail](../includes/gmail-archiving-options.md)]

5. Click **Save**. The e-mail (including any attachments) is archived to SuperOffice CRM as a new document. You can then double-click the e-mail in the **Activities** section tab to open it.

Click the link in the pop-up message to open the document in SuperOffice.

> [!TIP]
> If you do not archive the message when you send it, you can still go to the sent folder and archive the message as described in [Archive incoming e-mail](e-mail-archive-incoming.md).
