# Archive incoming email

You can archive an incoming e-mail (including any attachments) as a document in SuperOffice CRM. This is a convenient way of storing information you have received via e-mail together with other company/contact information in SuperOffice CRM.

Follow these steps:

1. In the Gmail inbox, select the e-mail you would like to archive.

2. Click ![icon](media/btn-archive.png) in the e-mail toolbar.

    If the sender of the e-mail is not listed in SuperOffice CRM, a warning will appear at the top of the dialog. See [Handling e-mails from senders not registered in SuperOffice](Handling-e-mails-from-senders-not-listed-in-SuperOffice.md). A warning also appears if the sender is registered on multiple companies in SuperOffice CRM. See [Handling e-mails from senders with several listings](Handling-e-mails-from-senders-with-several-listings.md).

3. In the dialog, the **Company** and **Contact** fields have been filled in if the sender is registered in SuperOffice. Fill in relevant information in the following fields:

    [!include[Archiving options for Gmail](../includes/gmail-archiving-options.md)]

4. Click **Save**. The selected e-mail (including any attachments) is archived to SuperOffice CRM as a new document. You can then double-click the e-mail in the **Activities** section tab to open it.

Click the link in the pop-up message to open the document in SuperOffice.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also archive attachments as documents. See [Archive attachments](Archive-attachments.md).
