# Handling e-mails from senders not registered in SuperOffice

When you archive an e-mail or an attachment, or create an activity or request based on an e-mail message, SuperOffice CRM performs a search to see if the sender matches any of the recorded companies or contacts. If the sender of the e-mail is not found in SuperOffice, you can add the sender's e-mail address to an existing contact, or create a new contact in a new or existing company.

> [!NOTE]
> This procedure also applies to outgoing e-mails where the e-mail address of a recipient is not registered in SuperOffice.

Follow these steps:

1. Process the e-mail or attachment as described in one of these topics:
    * [Archive incoming e-mail](e-mail-archive-incoming.md)
    * [Archive outgoing e-mail](e-mail-archive-outgoing.md)
    * [Archive attachments](Archive-attachments.md)
    * [Create activity](Archive-emails-as-activities.md)
    * [Create request](Archive-emails-as-requests.md)
2. If the sender of the e-mail or attachment is not listed in SuperOffice CRM, a warning will appear at the top of the dialog for archiving e-mail. Click the warning. The dialog **Add e-mail address to SuperOffice** opens.
3. Here you have the following options:
    * **Could it be one of these?** SuperOffice will try to match the sender with existing contacts in the database. Click one of the suggested contacts if it matches the sender.
    * Search: Search for a company or contact to which you want to add the sender's e-mail address.
    * **Create new company and contact**: Click this button if the sender is a new contact from a company not previously registered in SuperOffice. Fill in the relevant fields and click **Save**.
4. Click **Save**.

When you return from the dialog **Add e-mail address to SuperOffice**, the company and contact is filled in and the warning is removed.

> [!NOTE]
> If you do not want to add the e-mail address to SuperOffice, you can manually select a company and contact.
