# Handling e-mails from senders with several listings

When you archive an e-mail or an attachment, or create an activity based on an e-mail, SuperOffice CRM performs a search to see if the e-mail address matches any of the recorded companies or contacts. If the e-mail address is listed more than once in SuperOffice CRM, a warning displays in the dialog **Archive e-mail in SuperOffice**. Click the warning to select the correct contact.
