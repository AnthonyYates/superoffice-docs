1. In the Gmail inbox, open an e-mail containing one or more attachments.

2. Hold the mouse-pointer over the attachment you want to archive.

3. Click the SuperOffice icon (![icon](../media/btn-ArchiveAttachment.png)). The dialog **Archive attachment as a SuperOffice document** opens.

    If the sender of the e-mail is not listed in SuperOffice CRM, a warning will appear at the top of the dialog. See [Handling e-mails from senders not registered in SuperOffice](Handling-e-mails-from-senders-not-listed-in-SuperOffice.md). A warning also appears if the sender is registered on multiple companies in SuperOffice CRM. See [Handling e-mails from senders with several listings](Handling-e-mails-from-senders-with-several-listings.md).

4. In the dialog, the **Company** and **Contact** fields have been filled in if the sender is registered in SuperOffice. Fill in relevant information in the following fields:
    * **Subject**: The subject is automatically inserted in this field. However, you can edit the text.
    * **Company**: Search for a company by starting to type the company name or select a company in the list.
    * **Contact**: Select a contact in the list. You can also search by starting to type the contact name.

    * **Project**: If relevant, link the document to a project.
    * **Date**: Today's date is automatically inserted in this field. Click the field to select another date.
    * **Type**: Select one of the available document templates.
    * **Visible for**: Select whether the document will be visible to all users, private visible only to the owner) or visible to all users in a user group to which the owner belongs.
