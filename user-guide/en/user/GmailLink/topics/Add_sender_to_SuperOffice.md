# Look up sender to SuperOffice

You can easily look up information about a sender in SuperOffice CRM.

Follow these steps:

1. In the Gmail inbox, open an e-mail.
2. Click the arrow button next to the sender's name and e-mail address in the e-mail header.
3. What happens next, depends on whether the sender's e-mail address is found or not found in SuperOffice:
    * If the e-mail address is found on a company/contact, the company/contact card is displayed.
    * If the e-mail address is registered on more than one company/contact, a dialog will appear, listing the alternatives and allowing you to choose one of them.
    * If the e-mail address is not registered in your SuperOffice client, you will be given the possibility of adding it.

    * Search: Search for a company or contact to which you want to add the sender's e-mail address.
    * **Create new company and contact**: Click this button if the sender is a new contact from a company not previously registered in SuperOffice. Fill in the relevant fields and click **Save**.
