# Archive outgoing e-mail

When you send an e-mail, you can also archive it (including any attachments) as a document in SuperOffice CRM. This is a convenient way of keeping track of your outgoing correspondence.

Follow these steps:

1. In Gmail, click **Compose**.

2. Write the e-mail message.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you send the e-mail to multiple recipients, the e-mail is only archived on the first recipient.

3. Click **Send and archive**. The e-mail is sent and the dialog **Archive e-mail in SuperOffice** opens.

    If the recipient of the e-mail is not listed in SuperOffice CRM, a warning will appear at the top of the dialog. See [Handling e-mails from senders not registered in SuperOffice](Handling-e-mails-from-senders-not-listed-in-SuperOffice.md). A warning also appears if the recipient is registered on multiple companies in SuperOffice CRM. See [Handling e-mails from senders with several listings](Handling-e-mails-from-senders-with-several-listings.md).

4. In the dialog **Archive e-mail in SuperOffice**, the **Company** and **Contact** fields have been filled in if the recipient's e-mail address is registered in SuperOffice. Fill in relevant information in the following fields:
    * **Subject**: The subject is automatically inserted in this field. However, you can edit the text.
    * **Company**: Search for a company by starting to type the company name or select a company in the list.
    * **Contact**: Select a contact in the list. You can also search by starting to type the contact name.
    * **Sale**: If relevant, link the document to a sale.
    * **Project**: If relevant, link the document to a project.
    * **Date**: Today's date is automatically inserted in this field. Click the field to select another date.
    * **Type**: Select one of the available document templates.
    * **Visible for**: Select whether the document will be visible to all users, private visible only to the owner) or visible to all users in a user group to which the owner belongs.
    * **Mark as completed**: This option is checked by default, but you can uncheck it if necessary.

5. Click **Save**. The e-mail (including any attachments) is archived to SuperOffice CRM as a new document. You can then double-click the e-mail in the **Activities** section tab to open it.

Click the link in the pop-up message to open the document in SuperOffice.

> [!TIP]
> If you do not archive the message when you send it, you can still go to the sent folder and archive the message as described in [Archive incoming e-mail](e-mail-archive-incoming.md).
