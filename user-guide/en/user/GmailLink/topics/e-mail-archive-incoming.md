# Archive incoming e-mail

You can archive an incoming e-mail (including any attachments) as a document in SuperOffice CRM. This is a convenient way of storing information you have received via e-mail together with other company/contact information in SuperOffice CRM.

Follow these steps:

1. In the Gmail inbox, select the e-mail you would like to archive.

2. Click ![icon](../media/btn_Archive.png) in the e-mail toolbar.

    If the sender of the e-mail is not listed in SuperOffice CRM, a warning will appear at the top of the dialog. See [Handling e-mails from senders not registered in SuperOffice](Handling_e-mails_from_senders_not_listed_in_SuperOffice.md). A warning also appears if the sender is registered on multiple companies in SuperOffice CRM. See [Handling e-mails from senders with several listings](Handling_e-mails_from_senders_with_several_listings.md).

3. In the dialog, the **Company** and **Contact** fields have been filled in if the sender is registered in SuperOffice. Fill in relevant information in the following fields:
    * **Subject**: The subject is automatically inserted in this field. However, you can edit the text.
    * **Company**: Search for a company by starting to type the company name or select a company in the list.
    * **Contact**: Select a contact in the list. You can also search by starting to type the contact name.
    * **Sale**: If relevant, link the document to a sale.
    * **Project**: If relevant, link the document to a project.
    * **Date**: Today's date is automatically inserted in this field. Click the field to select another date.
    * **Type**: Select one of the available document templates.
    * **Visible for**: Select whether the document will be visible to all users, private visible only to the owner) or visible to all users in a user group to which the owner belongs.
    * **Mark as completed**: This option is checked by default, but you can uncheck it if necessary.

4. Click **Save**. The selected e-mail (including any attachments) is archived to SuperOffice CRM as a new document. You can then double-click the e-mail in the **Activities** section tab to open it.
