# Create request

You can create a request in SuperOffice Service based on an e-mail in your Gmail inbox.

> [!NOTE]
> This function requires a licence for SuperOffice Service.

Follow these steps:

1. In the Gmail inbox, open an e-mail.
2. Click the **More** button ( ![icon](../media/btn-archive-more.png) ) in the e-mail toolbar.
3. Select **Create request**. The dialog **Create request in SuperOffice based on e-mail** opens.
4. Click the request queue in which you want to place the request. Each queue has a specific category and priority assigned to it.
5. Click **Save** to save the request in SuperOffice Service. A message appears to confirm that the request has been created.
    * If the sender's e-mail address is recognised, the request is automatically linked to the correct contact and company.
    * If the sender's e-mail address is not recognised, the sender is automatically registered as a new contact in SuperOffice Service.
6. In the confirmation message, you can select **Click here to view it** if you would like to have a closer look at the request in SuperOffice Service.
