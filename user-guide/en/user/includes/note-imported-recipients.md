Imported recipients that ARE NOT found in the SuperOffice database, will only consist of a name and an email address (or just an email address). This means that only the template variables **\[\[customer.name\]\]** and/or **\[\[customer.email\]\]** will work for these recipients. To avoid empty variables in your mailings, make sure to [preview the mailing][1] first.
