<p>Answer: To keep track of all mailings related to your selections and 
 projects. The mailings are listed in the <span class="UI-text">Mailings</span> 
 section tab in <span class="UI-text">Selections</span>, and in the <span 
 class="UI-text">Activities</span> section tab in <span class="UI-text">Projects</span> 
 in <?rh-udv_start name="SO_User" ?>SuperOffice CRM<?rh-udv_end ?>.</p>
<p>Example: If you send out multiple mailings to promote an event, you 
 can add these mailings to a selection called &quot;Event 2015&quot; to 
 have a complete list of all mailings for this event.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you have created a project for your event, you can maintain 
 a list of all project-related mailings in the <span class="UI-text">Activities</span> 
 section tab.</p>
