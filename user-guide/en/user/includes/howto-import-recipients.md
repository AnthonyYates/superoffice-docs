You can import recipients from an [external comma-separated file][1] (.txt, .csv or similar).

> [!NOTE]
> When you import a list of names and e-mail addresses, SuperOffice Marketing will try to locate the imported recipients in the SuperOffice database. If matches are found, the recipients' companies will be listed in the **Company** column in the **Recipients** list. Any names/e-mail addresses that are **not** found in SuperOfffice, will be filtered out and not included in the mailing. This is due to GDPR regulations.

To do this:

1. Click **Select file**.

2. Locate the relevant file (.txt, .csv or similar text format).

3. Click ![icon][img1]. The list is added to the **Recipient sources** list, and the **Recipients** list is updated.

4. Repeat steps 2-4 to add more recipients. Additional recipients will be added to the same row in the **Recipient sources** list. The total number of recipients will display in the **Name** column.
