<body>
<p>To move criteria, click and drag <img src="StandardCRM/bitmaps/criteria_move.png" 
 alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" />. 
 This has no practical effect on the search, but allows you to arrange 
 the criteria in your preferred order. If some of the criteria are not 
 being used, but you still want to keep them, you can move inactive criteria 
 to the bottom if the list.</p>
