<li><span class="UI-text">Module</span>: In this list box, you can 
 select the SMS provider you have a contract with for sending SMS from 
 SuperOffice Service.</li>
<li><span class="UI-text">Default country code</span>: Here you need 
 to enter a default country code for the country you are in, e.g. +44 
 for the UK. This country code is used for mobile telephony. It is 
 used for outbound SMS (for example, when you don't enter the country 
 code of the mobile phone number you are sending to) and inbound SMS 
 (so that SuperOffice Service 
 can recognise the customer).</li>
<li><span class="UI-text">Sender</span>: Here you enter the sender 
 of the SMS messages. This text will appear on the recipient's mobile 
 phone.</li>
<li><span class="UI-text">Plugin configuration</span>: Here you must 
 enter (or paste in) the configuration for the selected module (received 
 from your SMS provider).</li>
