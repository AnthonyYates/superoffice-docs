# restore

<p class="Note"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>: You can restore 
 companies and contacts that have been deleted by mistake, either by yourself 
 or another user. Deleted companies and contacts are by default kept in 
 the recycle bin for 14 days. After this time, they are permanently deleted. 
 See <a href="StandardCRM/chap01/Restore_deleted_companies_and_contacts.htm">Restore 
 deleted companies and contacts</a>.</p>
