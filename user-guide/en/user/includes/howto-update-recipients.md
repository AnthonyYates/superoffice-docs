
When you add selections, projects, contacts and import lists, the **Recipients** list is automatically updated. If you have checked the option **Update recipient list when sending**, the projects and selections will be checked before sending the mailing, in case contacts have been added, removed or edited.

In addition, you can click the **Update list** button below the **Recipients** list to update the list manually. You should do this if it's been a while since you added the recipients. Some of the contacts on the list might have changed their consent in the mean time.

> [!NOTE]
> The list only displays the first 50 recipients. Click **Load all** at the bottom of the list to display all recipients.
