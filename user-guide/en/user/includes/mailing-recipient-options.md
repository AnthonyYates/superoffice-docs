Under **Options** in the lower part of the **Recipients** screen, you can select various options for the mailing.

What's available depends on whether you're creating a document, an email, or an SMS. Each option is explained below the table.

| Option | Document | Email | SMS |
|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Override consent and subscription | x | x | x |
| Only one message per email address | | x | x |
| Update recipient list when sending | | x | x |
| Include companies | x | x | |
| Prefer company | x | x | |

* **Override consent and subscription**: Select this option to also send the mailing to contacts who have not given their consent to receiving e-marketing or are not subscribing to this mailing type. These contacts are listed with the status **No consent** in the **Recipients** list.

* **Only one message per email address**: Select this option to remove duplicate email addresses in the recipient list (indicated by **Duplicate** in the **Status** column). This will update the **Recipients** list.

* **Update recipient list when sending**: Select this option to automatically update the recipients list before sending the mailing. See **Update recipients list** below.

* **Include companies**: Select this option to include companies as recipients.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If a company has no email address, the mailing will instead be sent to all related contacts in the recipient list.

* **Prefer company**: Select this option to send the mailing only to the companies in the recipient list (and not the related contacts). Each company will only receive one mailing. Contacts that do not belong to a company, will still receive the mailing.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Prefer company** option is only available if you have selected **Include companies** above.
