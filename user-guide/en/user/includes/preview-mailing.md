When you have added recipients to the **Recipients** list, you can preview the mailing as it will look for one of the recipients.

> [!NOTE]
> The mailing will **not** be sent to the recipient.

To do this:

* Click a recipient in the **Recipients** list.
* Click the **Preview** button. The **Preview** window displays the mailing as it will look for the selected recipient. Any template variables have been replaced by actual contact data (name, company etc.).
* Click links to check that they work, but remember to reset them if they are tracked. See [Reset counters after testing][1].
* Click ![icon][img1] to close the **Preview** window.
