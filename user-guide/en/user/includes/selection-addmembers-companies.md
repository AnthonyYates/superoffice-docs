<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
<li class="p">Click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Add Members</span> 
 button. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Add Members</span> dialog

<p class="Note"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> The <span 
 style="font-weight: bold;">Add Members</span> dialog is also displayed 
 automatically when you save a new static selection. See <a href="StandardCRM/chap04/Creating_static_selections.htm">Create 
 static selections</a>.</p>
<li class="p">Click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Add</span>

<li class="p">Select search criteria in the different fields by clicking 
 the arrow ( <img src="StandardCRM/bitmaps/Dialogboksknapper_pil ned.bmp" 
 alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" /> ) and 
 select from the list box that appears. The search criteria for selections 
 work in the same way as for <span style="font-weight: bold;">Find</span>.</li>
<li class="p">Repeat points 2 and 3 until you have specified all the 
 search criteria you require.</li>
<li class="p">If no contact criteria (i.e. those that apply only to 
 contacts, such as birth year or position) are specified in the upper 
 part of the dialog, you can choose from the following criteria under 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;">If no contact criteria are specified</span>: 
 
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
<li class="p"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Include main contact</span>: 
 For any companies which match the criteria you have specified, 
 the first contact on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Contacts</span> 
 section tab is shown as a selection member.</li>
<li class="p"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Include all contacts 
 for each company</span>: For any companies which match the criteria 
 you have specified, all contacts are shown.</li>
<li class="p"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Do not include contacts</span>: 
 For any companies which match the criteria you have specified, 
 no contacts are shown.</li>
</ul></li>
<li class="p">Check <span style="font-weight: bold;">Include companies 
 with Stop</span> to include companies which are marked with a stop, 
 i.e. which have a stop sign on the company card and where you have 
 to check whether any special notes have been entered. By default, 
 these companies are excluded from any search, but you can override 
 the default using this option.</li>
<li class="p">Check <span style="font-weight: bold;">Include companies 
 with No Mailings</span> to include companies which do not receive 
 direct mailings. By default, these companies are excluded from any 
 search, but you can override the default using this option.</li>
<li class="p">Click <span style="font-weight: bold;">OK</span>. A dialog 
 box displays the number of selection members that have been added 
 to the selection.</li>
</ol>
