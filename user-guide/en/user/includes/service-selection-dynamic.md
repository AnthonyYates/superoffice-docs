# SERVICE_selection_dynamic

<p>A dynamic selection can be compared to a saved search that is executed 
 each time you view the selection. Each time you add a record that fulfils 
 the search criteria in a dynamic selection, the selection will be updated 
 with the new record, unlike a static selection. You could, for example, 
 create a dynamic selection containing all requests belonging to a specific 
 category and which have a high priority. See <a href="Service/topics/selections.newSelection.newDynamicSelection.html">Create 
 a dynamic selection</a>.</p>
