<p class="Prosedyre">Review and update the Recipients list</p>
<p>When you add selections, projects, contacts and import lists, the <span 
 class="UI-text">Recipients</span> list is automatically updated. If 
 you have checked the option <span class="UI-text">Update recipient list 
 when sending</span>, the projects and selections will be checked before 
 sending the mailing, in case contacts have been added, removed or edited.</p>
<p>In addition, you can click the <span class="UI-text">Update list</span> 
 button below the <span class="UI-text">Recipients</span> list to update 
 the list manually. You should do this if it's been a while since you added 
 the recipients. Some of the contacts on the list might have changed 
 their consent in the mean time.</p>
<p class="Note"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> The list 
 only displays the first 50 recipients. Click <span class="UI-text">Load 
 all</span> at the bottom of the list to display all recipients.</p>
