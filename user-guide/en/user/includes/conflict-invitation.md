<p>You can create follow-ups that overlap each other. When you try to record 
 an overlapping follow-up, the dialog for follow-ups will have an exclamation 
 mark (&#160;<img src="StandardCRM/bitmaps/invitation_dialog_exclamation_mark.bmp" 
 alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" />&#160;) 
 next to the start and stop fields and you will also be offered a suggestion 
 for the first vacant time slot. This is intended to be a reminder to you, 
 since you can still record the follow-up. Click the proposed time to the 
 right of <span style="font-weight: bold;">First available</span> if you 
 want to select this time instead. </p>
<p>Overlapping follow-ups are displayed in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Diary</span> 
 screen so that you can see part of each follow-up.</p>
