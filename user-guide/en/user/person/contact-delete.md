# Delete contacts (Contact screen)

Why would you delete contacts in SuperOffice? A contact may have been added by mistake or be a duplicate, or a contact has been added with only a first name etc.

There are three ways you can delete a contact from SuperOffice CRM:

* Delete a contact from the **Contact** screen, as described below.
* Delete a contact from the **Company** screen. See [Delete contacts (Company screen)][1].
* Bulk delete contacts at once. See [Bulk update][3].

> [!TIP]
> Instead of deleting a contact, you can check **Former employee** in the contact card (see [Create new contacts][6]). Then this personâ€™s name will not disappear from activities, for example, to which he or she is linked.

To delete a contact:

1. [!include[Go to Contact screen](../includes/goto-contact.md)]
2. Click the **Task** button ( ![icon][img1] ) and select **Delete**. The **Delete Contact** dialog opens.
3. Click **Yes** to confirm that you really want to delete the contact. (For more details about this, see [Delete items in SuperOffice CRM][4].)
