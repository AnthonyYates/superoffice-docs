# Contacts

The **Contact** screen is used to display individual contacts. Contacts that are associated with a company can also be viewed in the **Contacts** section tab in the **Company** screen. All activities added to a contact will also be added to the associated company. See [Company][1].

In the **Contact** screen, every record in the database is displayed like an index card. A record in a database contains all the information that has been entered for a contact.

To move backwards and forwards between contacts, click the previous/next buttons ( ![icon][img2] ![icon][img1] ) at the bottom right of the cards

You can [search][8] for specific contacts based on criteria that you specify. You can also write documents, generate follow-ups and create new contacts.

The bottom of the **Contact** screen contains five default section tabs: **Activities**, **Sales**, **Requests**, **Projects** and **Relations**. Everything you need to find out about a contact is available from a single screen.
