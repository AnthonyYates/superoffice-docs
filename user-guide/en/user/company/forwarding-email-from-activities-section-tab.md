# Forward e-mail from the Activities section tab

E-mail messages that are saved as documents for a specific company are displayed on the **Activities** section tab for that company. To forward such an e-mail:

1. [!include[Go to company](../includes/goto-company.md)]
2. Select the **Activities** section tab.
3. Select the required e-mail message.
4. Right-click and choose **Forward**. The original message is displayed in your e-mail program.
5. Add the recipient(s) and any supplementary information.
6. When you have finished the message, and want to send it, you have the following options:
    * To send the message straightaway, click the **Send** button.
    * To send the message and archive it as a document in SuperOffice CRM, click **Send and archive**. The **Document** dialog opens. See [Create new documents][1].
