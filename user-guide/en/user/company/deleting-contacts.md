# Delete contacts (Company screen)

Why would you delete contacts in SuperOffice? A contact may have been added by mistake or be a duplicate, or a contact has been added with only a first name etc.

There are three ways you can delete a contact from SuperOffice CRM:

* Delete a contact from the **Company** screen. See below.
* Delete a contact from the **Contact** screen. See [Delete contacts (Contact screen)][1].
* Bulk delete contacts at once. See [Bulk update][4].

> [!TIP]
> Instead of deleting a contact, you can check **Former employee** in the contact card (see [Create new contacts][2]). Then this personâ€™s name will not disappear from activities, for example, to which he or she is linked.

To delete a contact:

1. [!include[Go to company](../includes/goto-company.md)]
2. Select the **Contacts** section tab.
3. Select the required contact.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can select and delete several contacts simultaneously.

4. Click the **Delete** button in the footer of the **Contacts** section tab. The **Delete Contact** dialog opens. You can also right-click the contact and select **Delete**.

5. Click **Yes** to confirm that you really want to delete the contact. (For more details about this, see [Delete items in SuperOffice CRM][5].)
