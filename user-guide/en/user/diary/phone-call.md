# Phone Call

Calls are follow-ups with a default duration of 15 minutes. The default start time is the current time and the date is todayâ€™s date. You can set up a call follow-up if, for example, you want to enter an outgoing phone call.

> [!TIP]
> You can change the default duration to something other than 15 minutes. Select ![icon][img1] **Personal settings &gt; Preferences** &gt; **Default values** &gt; **Duration of a new phone call** and enter the required value as described under [Preferences][4].

No matter where you are in SuperOffice CRM, you can create a new phone call by selecting **New** &gt; **Phone Call** on the top bar.

Phone calls can be displayed in the following places in SuperOffice CRM:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD032 -->
[!include[List of Activities section tabs](../includes/list-activities-section-tabs.md)]
* on the **Day**/**Week**/**Month**/**View** tabs in the **Diary** screen.
* in these side panel views: **Day**, **Month**, **Next day** and **Week**.
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

The [Enter phone calls][2] topic describes how to enter a phone call. Other aspects of phone calls are explained in general under [Activities in SuperOffice CRM][1] and [Work with follow-ups][3].
