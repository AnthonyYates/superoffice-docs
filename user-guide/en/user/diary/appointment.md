# Appointment

Appointments are activities with a defined start and end time, such as meetings. The default duration for an appointment is 1 hour, but you can of course change the duration as required.

> [!TIP]
> This is done in the **Preferences** dialog, which you open by choosing **Preferences** on the **Personal settings** menu. Select **Default values**, and enter the required value under **Duration for new appointment** as described under [Preferences][1].

No matter where you are in SuperOffice CRM, you can create a new appointment by clicking the **New** button in the Top bar.

Appointments can be displayed in the following places in SuperOffice CRM:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD032 -->
[!include[List of Activities section tabs](../includes/list-activities-section-tabs.md)]
* on the **Day**/**Week**/**Month**/**View** tabs in the **Diary** screen
* in these side panel views: **Day**, **Month**, **Next day** and **Week**
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

The [Create appointments][2] topic describes how to create an appointment. Other aspects of appointments are explained in general under [Activities in SuperOffice CRM][4] and [Work with follow-ups][3].
