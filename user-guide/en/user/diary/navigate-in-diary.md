# Navigate in the Diary screen

There are different ways of navigating in the diary.

## Move between dates

To move between the different days, weeks or months in the **Diary** screen:

* click the word **Diary** in the Navigator and select a time period from the list that appears, or click **Today** or **This week** to move to the current day or week.
* click the previous/next buttons ( ![icon][img2] ![icon][img1] ) at the bottom right of the Diary.
* (if open) click a day or week in the day, week or month view in the side panel.
* in the **Day** tab, **Week** tab and **Month** tab you can click **Today** or **This week** to move to the current day or week.

## Switch views

The diary consists of four different tabs: **Day** tab, **Week** tab, **Month** tab and **View** tab. Switching between these views is easy: simply click the tabs at the top of the **Diary** screen. The relevant day, week or month is displayed at the top of the page, depending on which tab you select.

> [!TIP]
> Click **Diary** in the navigator and click a month, week number or a day in the calendar to move directly to one of the tabs above.

For more details about the different views, see [Tabs in the Diary screen][1].
