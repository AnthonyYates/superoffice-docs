# Show follow-ups you are invited to

When you view a follow-up you are not the owner of, the usual **Appointment**, **Task** or **Phone Call** dialog is displayed. [!include[See Appointment dialog](../../includes/see-apt-dialog.md)] However, you cannot make changes to other people's invitations, nor add participants, so the **Add** button in the **Participants** tab is disabled.

Note:

* Until you accept or decline the invitation, two extra buttons will be displayed in the dialog: **Accept** and **Decline**. Once you accept, the button is disabled. If you decline the invitation, it works as described under [Accept or decline invitations][2].
* Since you will not have created the appointment, task or phone call yourself, you will not be allowed to make changes other than to the **Priority**, **Alarm** and **Completed** fields. All other options will be disabled.

## What would you like to do now?
