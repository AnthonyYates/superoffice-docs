# The View tab

The **View** tab in the **Diary** screen shows your own diary with your user ID at the top of the page.

The **View** tab is used mainly to open and look at overviews of other users or resources, in order to find out when they will be available, before inviting them to a meeting by linking them to follow-ups, or creating follow-ups for them. (See [Add participants to follow-ups][5] and [Create appointments for associates][4].)
