# Manage follow-ups in the Diary

Follow-ups are a key concept in SuperOffice CRM and are described under [Work with follow-ups][8]. However, follow-ups are closely linked to the **Diary** screen, and some functions apply especially to the Diary. The topics below describe how to manage follow-ups in the **Diary** screen directly.

> [!NOTE]
> It is important to understand the distinction between activities and follow-ups (appointments, tasks and phone calls).
When you create follow-ups from the **Diary** screen, by default they are defined as appointments. However, you can change the follow-up type to task or phone call in the type field in the **Appointment** dialog. [!include[See Appointment dialog](../../includes/see-apt-dialog.md)]
