# Move follow-ups using drag and drop

[!include[Note](../includes/note-edit-followup.md)]

At some time, you will undoubtedly need to move follow-ups from one time slot to another, from the activities list to the **Diary** screen, or from the **Diary** screen to the activities list. These actions can be accomplished quickly and easily in SuperOffice CRM by dragging and dropping with the mouse.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only move one follow-up at a time, and only follow-ups that are not completed. (See [Change Completed status of an activity][1].)

## What would you like to do now?

* [Move follow-ups to a different time][2]
* [Move follow-ups between the activities list and the Diary][3]
