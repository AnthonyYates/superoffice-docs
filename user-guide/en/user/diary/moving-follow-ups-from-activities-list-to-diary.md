# Move follow-ups between the activities list and the Diary

You can move a follow-up from the activities list to the Diary. This can be useful if you have moved a follow-up from the Diary to the activities list and want it back in the Diary, e.g. on a different date.

[!include[To do this](../../includes/to-do-this.md)]

1. Select the required tab in the **Diary** screen (**Day**, **Week**, **Month** or **View**).
2. Grab the follow-up in the activities list by clicking down on it with the mouse button.
3. Drag the follow-up to the required time and/or day in the Diary and release the mouse button. The follow-up is entered in the Diary. It is removed from the activities list if the criteria for inclusion in the activities list are no longer fulfilled (see [Activities section tab][1]).

> [!TIP]
> Select the **Week** or **Month** view in the side panel, go to the required week or month in the Diary and then drag the follow-up from the Diary to the required day in the side panel. The diary automatically updates with the required week or month.

If you have entered a follow-up in the Diary but are not yet sure of the time or date to allocate to it, you can enter it in the activities list temporarily. Move the follow-up from the Diary to the activities list using drag and drop.

> [!TIP]
> You can also use drag and drop to move an appointment that is already in the Diary to a different time or day.
