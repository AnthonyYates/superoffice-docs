# Edit repeating follow-ups

You can make changes to all repeating follow-ups of which you are the owner (for more details, see [The Details tab][1]). Changes work in the same way as described under [Edit follow-ups][2], but when you make a change, the **Repeating follow-ups** dialog appears, giving a brief description of the follow-up.

In the **Repeating follow-ups** dialog, you have two options:

* If you select **Change only this instance**, the change will not affect other times.
* If you select **Change all future instances including this one**, the change will apply to this follow-up in the future as well.

## What would you like to do now?

* [Create repeating follow-ups][3]
* [Receive invitations][4]
* [Stop repeating follow-ups][5]
