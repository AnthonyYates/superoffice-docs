# Move follow-ups to a different time

[!include[Note](../includes/note-edit-followup.md)]

To move a follow-up to a different time or to a different day in the Diary:

1. Select the required tab in the **Diary** screen (**Day**, **Week**, **Month** or **View**).
2. Drag and drop the required follow-up to a different time.

> [!TIP]
> You can check the time and duration for a follow-up by holding the mouse pointer over it in the **Diary** screen. This displays a tooltip containing information about the follow-up.

## Move a follow-up from one week or month to another

* Select the **Week** or **Month** view in the side panel, go to the required week or month and then drag the follow-up from the Diary to the required day in the side panel. The diary automatically updates with the required week or month.
* Move the follow-up temporarily to the activities list, go to the required week or month and then drag the follow-up back to the required day in the Diary (see [Move follow-ups between the activities list and the Diary][1]).
