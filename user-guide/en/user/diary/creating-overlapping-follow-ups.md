# Create overlapping follow-ups

You can create follow-ups that overlap each other. When you try to record an overlapping follow-up, the dialog for follow-ups will have an exclamation mark (![icon][img1]) next to the start and stop fields and you will also be offered a suggestion for the first vacant time slot. This is intended to be a reminder to you, since you can still record the follow-up. Click the proposed time to the right of **First available** if you want to select this time instead.

Overlapping follow-ups are displayed in the **Diary** screen so that you can see part of each follow-up.
