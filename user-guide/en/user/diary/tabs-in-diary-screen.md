# Tabs in the Diary screen

The diary consists of four different tabs which you can select simply by clicking them at the top of the **Diary** screen.

Click the word **Diary** in the Navigator and select a time period from the list that appears.

You can create, edit, move and delete follow-ups directly in these tabs (see [Manage follow-ups in the Diary][1]). Click and drag a follow-up to reschedule it.

Follow-ups with times are displayed as boxes in the different views in the **Diary** screen, with information about the company and the type of follow-up. The following icons are also displayed:

| Icon | Description | Read more |
|:-:|---|---|
| ![icon][img1] | Means that this is a repeating follow-up. | [Create repeating follow-ups][6] |
| ![icon][img2] | Means that the follow-up has several participants. | [Invite your associates to a follow-up][7] |
| ![icon][img3] | Means that the follow-up has been completed. | [Change Completed status of an activity][8] |
| ![icon][img4] | Means that the follow-up has an active alarm. | |
| ![icon][img5] | Means that there are unanswered invitations for this follow-up. | [Status of invitations][9] |
| ![icon][img6] | Means that this follow-up is a video meeting. To join the meeting, right-click the follow-up and select **Join meeting**. | [Work with video meetings][10] |

By default, the follow-ups are displayed as a blue field in the diary tabs. If you hold the mouse pointer over one of these fields, a tooltip is displayed showing more information about the follow-up. You can also double-click the blue field to open the follow-up.

> [!NOTE]
> In SuperOffice Settings and maintenance, you can define that all follow-ups of a specific type will be displayed in the **Diary** screen in SuperOffice CRM with a different background colour from the usual blue.
