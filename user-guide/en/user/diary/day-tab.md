# The Day tab

The **Day** tab displays one day at a time.

Along the left-hand edge of the **Day** tab, there are hourly time intervals. You can scroll up and down the time intervals.

At the bottom left of the **Day** tab is a field for selecting a time zone, if time zones have been enabled in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance. (See [Time zones][1].)
