# Save reports as files

You can save generated reports as documents, so they can later be opened from the report archive (see [Manage saved reports][1]) or from the **Activities** section tab. The reports are saved as PDFs.

> [!NOTE]
> Saving reports as files is managed slightly differently for cross table reports than for other types. See [Save cross table reports as files][2].

1. Open the **Reports** screen.
    <!-- Fix reuse ID=a2 -->
    [!include[How to-goto-reports](../includes/goto-reports.md
)]
2. Select the required report (see [Show report properties][3]).

> [!TIP]
> To see on screen what the finished report will look like, use the preview function (see [View reports][4]).

1. Click the **Save** button under the criteria list. The **Document** dialog opens.

> [!NOTE]
> If the report is of the type label, you need to specify a label layout in the **Choose label** dialog before the **Document** dialog is displayed.

1. Enter the required information about the report. See [The Document dialog][5].
2. Click **Create**. The file is opened in the default PDF viewer and simultaneously saved in SuperOffice CRM.
