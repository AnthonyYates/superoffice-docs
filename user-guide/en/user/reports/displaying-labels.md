1. Open the **Reports** screen.

)]

2. Select the required report (see [Show report properties][1]).

3. Click the **Preview** button under the criteria list.

4. In the **Choose label** dialog, select the required label format.

    > You can also add, edit and delete label formats. This is described under [Add label formats][2], [Edit label formats][3] and [Remove label formats][4].

5. Click **OK**. A PDF is generated in your browser.
