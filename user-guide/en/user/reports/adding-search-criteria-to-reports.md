# Add criteria to reports

You can add more search criteria to a report. If you add criteria to a standard report, you need to save it as a favourite report to keep the changes in the report (see [Add favourite reports][1]).

To add search criteria to reports:

1. Open the **Reports** screen.
    <!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->
    [!include[How to-goto-reports](../includes/goto-reports.md
)]
2. Select a tab. The reports are displayed in the report list.

> [!NOTE]
> It is not recommended that you run reports without specifying search criteria, as this may generate extremely large reports and result in time-consuming processing.

1. Click the **Add** button at the bottom of the criteria list. The **Add/edit search criteria** dialog appears.
2. Enter the required information as described under [Use search criteria][2].

> [!NOTE]
> The criteria you can choose from vary according to the tab and report you have selected.

1. Click **OK** at the bottom of the **Add/edit search criteria** dialog when you have finished.
