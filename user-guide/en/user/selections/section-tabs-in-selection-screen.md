# Tabs in the Selection screen

The **Selection** screen contains the following section tabs:

[!include[List of tabs on Selection](../includes/selections-tabs.md)]

> [!TIP]
> Click ![icon][img1] on the far right of the column headers in a selection. Here you can group and filter records, and add/remove columns. These settings can be saved for the active selection by selecting **Save columns for current selection only**. See also [The section tabs][1] for additional functions.
