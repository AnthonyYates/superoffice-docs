# Copy selections

Selecting the **Copy the selection** task provides a quick and easy way of making an exact copy of a selection. When you click this button, a copy of the selection is created, with the text (copy) next to the selection name. In other words, if you copy the selection named *My static selection*, the copy will be named *My static selection (copy)*.

1. Follow the procedure described under [Perform tasks using selections][1].
2. Select the **Copy the selection** task. This creates a copy of the selection.
3. Give the new selection a new name.
