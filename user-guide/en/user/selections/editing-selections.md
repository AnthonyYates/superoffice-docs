# Edit selections

> [!NOTE]
> To edit a selection, you must own it or have administrator access.

To edit an existing selection:

1. Open the **Selection** screen.
    <!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->
    [!include[Howto](../includes/goto-selections.md)]
2. Go to the required selection. You can, for example, search as described under [Use the Find screen][1].
3. Open the **Details** tab.
4. Click **Edit**. The **Selection** tab changes to edit mode.
5. In the **Selection** is list, you can change a dynamic or combined selection into a static selection. <!-- Fix reuse ID=a2 -->
    Once you have added members to a selection, the following applies:

    * You cannot change a static selection into a dynamic one, because the static selection does not contain any search criteria.
    * You can, however, turn a dynamic selection into a static one. The search result is then saved into a fixed, static selection that is not updated even if you subsequently add more companies that match the search criteria you specified for the dynamic selection.
    * You can turn a combined selection into a static one. The search result is then saved as a fixed, static selection.
6. When you have made the required changes, click **Save** to close and save the changes. Click **Cancel** if you want to reject your changes.
