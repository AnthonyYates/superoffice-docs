# Respond to a chat

Incoming chats are announced in the following ways:

* ![icon](media/chat-tab-dashbiard.png) A number icon on the **Dashboard** tab. The number indicates how many incoming chats have not been answered by an agent.
* In the **Incoming chat** list in the **Dashboard** tab. You can double-click a row to respond to a chat.
* In the **Chats** tab, the **In queue** field will show how many unanswered chats are in queue.
* A warning popup if a chat has not been answered within a specified amount of time. You will only see the warning if your status is **Present**.

## Setting your status (Present/Away)

In the top-right corner of the **Chat** screen, you can set your presence:

![icon](media/chat-status-present.png) You will be listed as a present agent and will receive warnings of unanswered chats.

![icon](media/chat-status-away.png) You will not be listed as a present agent and will not receive warnings of unanswered chats. However, you can still respond to incoming chats.

> [!NOTE]
> If all agents have status **Away**, the customer will only see the offline form when they start the chat.

2. In the top-right corner, make sure your status is set to **Present**.
