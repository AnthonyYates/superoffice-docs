# Chat

The **Chat** feature in SuperOffice allows your support agents and sales people to chat with customers, potential customers and other people via the chat widget/window on your web site. This feature can for instance be used for service/support and pre-sales, and it easily integrates with [FAQ](../Service/topics/document.faq.md), [documents/attachments](../Service/topics/document.document.md) and [templates](../Service/topics/document.replyTemplates.md). The chat feature can be set up with multiple chat channels for different topics, such as technical support, product questions and sales support.

Your agents can access chat via the Navigator in both SuperOffice CRM and SuperOffice Service.

The **Chat** screen consists of the following tabs:

* **Dashboard**: This tab displays statistics for all or selected chat channels. Incoming chats and ongoing chat sessions are listed here.
* **Chats**: This is where the agent chats with customers.
