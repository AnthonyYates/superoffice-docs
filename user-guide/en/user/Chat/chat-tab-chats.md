# The Chats tab

Use the **Chats** tab to respond to incoming chats from customers.

![icon](media/loc/chat-tab-chats.png) The number in the **Chats** tab indicates the number of chats you are currently handling.

The **Chats** tab has three main areas:

* List of active/recent chat sessions (left side)
* Chat conversation (middle)
* Contact side panel (right side) â†’ showing customer information

## List of active/recent chat sessions

This list contains

* ongoing chats
* recently completed chats (last 8 hours)

The number of chats in queue is also listed here, and you can click **Get next in queue** to respond to the next chat in the queue.

The following icons are used for the active chat sessions in the list:

<table>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><p>Icon</p></td>
<td><p>Description</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>![icon](media/chat-last-customer.png)</td>
<td>The last message in the conversation from the customer and agent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>![icon](media/chat-last-customer-unanswered.png)</td>
<td>Number of unread messages from the customer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>![icon](media/chat-transfered.png)</td>
<td>Transferred chat to you or from you. Waiting to be accepted.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Chat conversation

Here you can chat with the customer. See [Respond to a chat](chat-respond.md).

## Contact side panel (right side)

When a customer contacts you in the chat and is already registered in SuperOffice, you can display relevant information about them in the side panel on the right side of the **Chat** screen. You can also add new customers as new contacts (and new companies). See [The contact side panel](chat-Person-side-panel.md).
