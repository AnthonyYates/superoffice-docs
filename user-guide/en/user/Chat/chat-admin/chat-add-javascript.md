# Add JavaScript for your website

To make the chat feature available to your customers, you must add a JavaScript to the relevant pages on your website. If you have set up multiple chat channels, each chat channel has a specific JavaScript which must be added to the relevant page(s).

In order to do so:

1. SuperOffice CRM: Click the **Chat** button in the Navigator (![icon](../media/Knapp-chat-liten.png)).  
    SuperOffice Service: Select ![icon](../media/globalmenu-settings-small.png)**System settings &gt; Chat**.
2. Select a chat channel in the list.
3. Click **View**. The JavaScript for the selected chat channel is displayed.
4. Select and copy the script.
5. Add the script to the relevant pages on your website.

> [!NOTE]
> The *DEFER* parameter ensures that this script does not block page loading. The script will run after the page has finished loading.
