# Test mailing

> [!NOTE]
> This topic is only relevant for e-mail mailings and form responses (not for documents or SMS).

When you create a new mailing, you can also do a few tests to check that the mailing is working properly and that the layout looks OK.

## Send a test email

In the **Content** step you can send a test e-mail.

In order to do this:

1. Go to the **Content** step.
2. Click the **Send test** button in the lower left corner.
3. Enter an e-mail address. You can add multiple e-mail addresses by using ; as separator.
4. Click **OK**. The e-mail is sent to the specified address(es).

See [What should I test?](test-mailing.md#What-should-I-test-) below for a list of what you should check in the mailing.

## Preview the mailing

## What should I test?

When you are testing a mailing, it is important to check the following:

* That template variables are replaced with customer data. This means, for example, that you see "Hi John" and not "Hi **\[\[customer.firstname\]\]**".
* That links work and point to the correct pages.
* That clicks on links are registered in SuperOffice Marketing.
* That the opening of messages is registered in SuperOffice Marketing.
* That images are correctly displayed.
* That the layout of messages looks good.
* That the messages are up-to-date (dates/years, names, version numbers, etc.) and do not contain spelling mistakes/typos.
* That the mailing is legible on a smart phone or tablet. See [Customise the message for display on mobile devices](Customise-message-for-display-on-mobile-devices.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You need to remember to reset the counters after you have clicked links. See [Reset counters for links](Work-with-tracked-links-after-mailing.md#ResetCountersForLinks).

Click **Next** to go to **Step 4: Recipients**. You can still go back to the **Content** step to make additional changes to the message. This step is not relevant for form responses.
