# Reset counters after testing

When you have sent a test mailing, you need to reset the counters for the link(s) in the message. Otherwise, the list will display both your own and others' clicking of links done during testing.

[!include[To do this](../../includes/to-do-this.md)]

1. Go to the links **Tracked links** tab
2. Click the menu button ( ![icon][img1] ) next to the relevant link and select **Reset**. The **Clicks** column is set to **0**. Data about which customers have clicked the link are also removed.
