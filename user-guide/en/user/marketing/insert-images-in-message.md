## Using an image from the SuperOffice database

1. Go to the **Content** screen in the mailing, or open a template for editing.

2. Select **Content** (![icon](media/editor-sidepanel-btn-content-small.png)) in the side-panel.

3. Click and drag the **Image** block (![icon](media/editor-sidepanel-btn-content-image-small.png)) to the relevant section in the message. You must now select the image to use.

    To add a regular link (untracked): Select the image, and enter the link in the **URL** field.
