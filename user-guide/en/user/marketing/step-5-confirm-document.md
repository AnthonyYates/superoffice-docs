# Step 5: Confirm - Document

> [!NOTE]
> Document mailings are not actually sent when you click **Send now**. A PDF document is generated, containing all the pages to all the persons/companies you have selected as recipients in the mailing. You can [open and print](Step-5-Confirm-Document.md#Open-and-print-the-document) the PDF from the **View mailing** screen.

In the final step, **Confirm**, you can view a summary of the mailing and verify that these are correct. Any error messages displayed in this screen need to be solved before the mailing can be sent.

> [!NOTE]
> The send options are disabled if there are incomplete steps or missing information in your mailing. These are indicated in red.
