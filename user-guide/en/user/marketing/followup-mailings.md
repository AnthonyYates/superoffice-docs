# Follow up mailings

Some of the most important and useful functions in SuperOffice Marketing deal with following up a mailing after it has been sent.

* You can view the statistics of the mailing and get information about any problems that have arisen. See [Track the mailing and view statistics](Track-the-mailing-and-view-statistics.md).
* You can add recipients to selections and projects for further processing. See [Work with the recipient list after the mailing](Work-with-the-recipient-list-after-the-mailing.md).
* You can check and, where necessary, correct the addresses of undelivered mails. See [Filter recipient list](Filter-recipient-list.md).
* You can see who has clicked the trackable links you have inserted in the message. [Work with tracked links after the mailing](Work-with-tracked-links-after-the-mailing.md).
* You can manage e-mail addresses that have been returned due to permanent errors or have bounced several times. See [Manage bounces](Manage-bounces.md).
