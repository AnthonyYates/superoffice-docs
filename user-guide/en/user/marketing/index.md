# SuperOffice Marketing

SuperOffice Marketing is concerned with outbound communication and forms. Use mailings to inform customers about upgrades or product news, for example. Use forms for product/newsletter registration, consent management, data updates and simple "contact me" forms.

You can create the following mailings:

* E-mails to all or parts of your customer base
* SMS messages to all or parts of your customer base by mobile phone
* Merged documents (PDFs) to print and send by regular mail to all or parts of your customer base
* Form responses to customers or prospects that submit a form (see [Create a new form][1]) via your website or customer centre

> [!NOTE]
> E-mail mailings (and form responses) are the most feature-rich of these mailing types. Features such as tracked links and subscription links are not available in SMS mailings and document mailings. SMS mailings can only contain plain text (no images or tables).

The messages you send out can be customised for each customer using [template variables][2]. Add links to your mailings, and add [actions][3] to these links to automate your marketing workflow.

SuperOffice Marketing also deals with what happens after the mailing has been done. You can get instant feedback on the success of the mailing: you can see how many and which customers received and opened the mailing, you can see data on click frequency and see which mailings led to sales.

To get started, go to [Getting started][4].

> [!NOTE]
> Tracked links and reporting features require the Marketing User licence. You also need functional rights to edit and send mailings.
>
> SMS mailing is not available if you are using CRM Online.
