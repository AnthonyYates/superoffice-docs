# Menu overview

When you hover the mouse pointer over columns and paragraphs, menus are displayed in the form of toolbars at the top of the element in question. Which buttons are displayed depends on whether you are pointing at a column or a paragraph. If you hover the mouse pointer over a button in the menu, a red frame is shown around the element in question, so that you always know which part of the template you are editing.

## Global menu

From the global menu, you can edit the properties of the whole template, as well as undo or repeat actions and display or hide borders. This menu is always displayed at the top right in the content area (see [Edit message content – overview](Edit-message-content-overview.md)).

## Column menu

In the column menu, you can edit the properties of the column. This menu is shown at top left when you hover the mouse pointer over a column (see [Edit message content – overview](Edit-message-content-overview.md)).
