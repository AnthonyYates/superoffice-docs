# Include links you want to track

[!include[Requirement](../../includes/req-marketing.md)]

[!include[About links in mailings](../../includes/mailing-links-intro.md)] Read more about tracking in [Examples of the use of trackable links][1].

To add tracked links to the e-mail:

1. Go to the contents of the message and edit a paragraph (see [Edit a paragraph][2]) to open the **Edit paragraph** screen.
2. Select the **Body** tab.
3. Enter or select the text which the recipient has to click, for example "Click here for more information".
4. Select this text and click the ![icon][img3]**Tracked link** button in the toolbar. The **Add link** dialog opens.
5. Do one of the following:
    * Click ![icon][img2] **Choose link** to select an existing tracked link.
    * Start typing in the search field (below the **Choose link** and **New link** buttons) to search for existing tracked links.
    * Click ![icon][img1] **New link** to create a new link. Links that are created using this option, will only be available from this mailing (and copies of this mailing). To create a tracked link that can be used in other mailings as well, go to the **Tracked links** tab(see [Create tracked links][3]).
6. In the **Link label** field, you can edit the link text. Remember to add a space at the end of the text.
7. Click **OK** in the **Add link** dialog once you have finished adding links to the message. This takes you back to the **Edit paragraph** screen. The linked text is blue and underlined.
8. Click **OK**.

To view all the links in a mailing, open the mailing in view mode and select the **Tracked links** tab. See [Work with tracked links after the mailing][4].

> [!TIP]
> You can also add regular (untracked) links by clicking the link button ( ![icon][img3] ) in the toolbar. If you later decide you want to track these links also, you can select the **Track all links** option under **Tracking** in [Step 1: Setup][5]. These links will, however, only be tracked for the mailing in question, and will not be available for other mailings.
