# Insert images in the message

You insert an image in a message like this:

1. Go to the **Content** screen in the mailing, or open a template for editing.

2. Click the **Edit paragraph** ( ![icon](../media/btn-editor-edit.png) ) button in the paragraph where you wish to insert the image.

3. Select the **Image** tab.

4. Click **Browse** to the right of the **Image file** field to select the image you want to insert. You can select an image that is already available in SuperOffice Marketing or upload an image.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you want to use an image that is not in the list, you can click **Select file** to choose an image file on your PC, and then click **Upload**.

5. Click the image you want to insert. A preview of the image is displayed in the field on the right.

6. Click **Resize image** ( ![icon](../media/btn-resize.jpg) ). Here you can:
    * Change the title of the image in the **Image title** field.
    * Define the size of the image (in pixels). A maximum width of 600 pixels is normally recommended.

7. Click **OK** when you have finished.

8. Click ![icon](../media/btn-green-check.jpg)**Select this image** to use this image. This takes you back to the **Edit paragraph** dialog.

9. Select where to position the image in the text by checking one of the options for **Image position**.

10. Select the margins (space) you want around the image.

11. Select **Break line on mobile devices** to ensure that the image size is optimal for the mobile devices.

12. In the **Link for image** field, you can add a link to make the image clickable. For example, if you are inserting a picture of a product you are launching, you can add a link to an information page for the product. Here you have the following options:
    * Click ![icon](../media/btn-folder.png) to select an existing link (tracked).
    * Click ![icon][img1] to create a new link. See [Create tracked links](../Create-links.md).
    * Click ![icon](../media/btn-editor-edit.png) to edit a selected link. See [Create tracked links](../Create-links.md).
    * Enter the URL directly in the field.

13. Click **OK** when you have finished.

14. Check that the image is correctly displayed and adjust as necessary.
