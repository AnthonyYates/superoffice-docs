# Edit message content - overview

In the **Content** step you can edit the appearance and content of the message.

A message is made up of columns and paragraphs. You insert text and images in the individual paragraphs and you can define format/layout (such as font type and size, colours and margins) at global level (the whole template) or by column or paragraph.

SuperOffice Marketing is supplied with many ready-made message template layouts, and you can easily move columns and paragraphs around to get the appearance you want. You can also delete unwanted columns and paragraphs or add new ones.

> [!TIP]
> We normally recommend a maximum width of 600 pixels for mailings. You can also check what the mailing will look like, on smart phones for example, by clicking **Toggle view for mobile devices** ( ![icon][img1] ). See also [Customise the message for display on mobile devices][1].

Below you can see how a typical template is made up and how menus are displayed.

For a complete list of these menus and buttons, see [Menu overview][2].
