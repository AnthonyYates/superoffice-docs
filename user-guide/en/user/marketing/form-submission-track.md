# Track form submissions and view statistics

To view statistics about your form, go to the **Forms** tab and click the form in the list. The **View form** screen opens.

You can find form statistics in the following tabs:

## **Summary**

Here you can basic information about the form, including a preview of the form, and view various submission statistics:

* **Total submissions**: How many forms have been submitted.
* **Last submission**: When the last form was submitted.
* **Completion last 7 days**: Submitted forms per day the last 7 days.
* **Completion rate**: Status for submitted forms.
* **Mailing**: This field is visible if you have activated **E-mail response** for this form (see [Create a new form - Actions](form-create.md#form-actions)). Click the link to view information and statistics about the form response. See [Track the mailing and view statistics](Track-mailing-and-view-statistics.md).

## **Reports**

These charts show statistics for the form (mouse-over to view exact numbers).

## **Form submissions**

Here you can view and process all submitted forms. A red icon on the tab indicates new form submissions (![icon](media/btn-form-notification.png)).

Use the filter options at the bottom of the list to view only submissions with specific statuses. See [Process form submissions](form-submissions-process.md).
