# Add recipients to selections or projects

Using the ![icon][img1] menu button you can add recipients and clickers to a selection or project. <!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->

* In the **Recipients** tab in the **View mailing** screen (see [Work with the recipient list after the mailing](Work-with-recipient-list-after-mailing.md)).
* In the **Clickers** list in the **View link** screen (see [Work with tracked links after the mailing](Work-with-tracked-links-after-mailing.md)).

> [!NOTE]
> Only contacts already registered in the SuperOffice database will be added to the selection or project. A contact icon ![icon](media/btn-contact.png) in the **Type** column indicates that a contact is registered in the SuperOffice database. Recipients imported from external lists will typically not be registered.
