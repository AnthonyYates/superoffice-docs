# Create tracked links

[!include[Requirement](../includes/req-marketing.md)]

As mentioned under [Include links you want to track](includeLinksToTrack.md), you can track URLs inserted in e-mails. The **Tracked links** tab is used to administrate these trackable links. The links created here will be available when you and other users when you edit the contents of your mailings.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also create new links while editing the content. See [Include links you want to track](includeLinksToTrack.md).

To create a link:

1. Select the **Tracked links** tab.
2. Optional: Select a folder or create a new folder.

    [!include[How to create a mailing folder](../includes/create-mailing-folder.md)]

3. Click the ![icon][img1] **Add** button. This takes you to the **Link properties** screen.
4. Enter a descriptive name for the link in the **Name** field.
5. Under **Link actions** at the bottom of the screen, you can choose what should happen when the recipient clicks the link in the message. See [Define link actions][1].
6. Click **OK** when you are done.

A small dot on the link action tabs indicate which link actions are active. Multiple link actions can be active for a link.
