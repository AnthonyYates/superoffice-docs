# Form submissions

When a form is submitted from a Customer Centre or web site, the data is collected and displayed in the **Form submissions** tab. A red icon on the tab indicates new form submissions (![icon][img1]).

In the **Form submissions** tab you can view all submitted forms. Use the filter options at the bottom of the list to view only submissions with specific statuses.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also view submissions for individual forms by opening a form in the **Forms** tab. See [Track form submissions and view statistics][1].

The **Form status** column can have the following statuses:

* **Processed**: The form has been submitted and automatically processed.
* **Submitted**: The form has been submitted, but not processed yet.
* **Awaiting confirmation**: The form has been submitted, but the sender must confirm his/her e-mail address (double-opt in).
