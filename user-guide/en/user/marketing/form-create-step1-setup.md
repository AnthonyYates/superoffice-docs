# Step 1: Setup - Form response

The first step in creating a form response, is called **Setup**. Here you can set the e-mail header information such as sender, reply-to address and subject. You can also add attachments, set archive options for the mailing and select tracking options.

In order to do this:

1. Enter a name in the **Name of mailing** field.
2. Enter the subject of the e-mail in the **E-mail subject** field.
3. In the **From** list, select **Always use** and enter the sender's e-mail address in the field below to use the same sender for all mailings. You can also choose our contact or support contact as the sender, if one is defined for this recipient. Enter an e-mail address to be used if no sales contact or support contact is available.
4. In the **Reply to** list, you have the same options as above. In addition, you can select **Use "From" as reply address**. Any replies will then be sent to the sender.
5. In the **Folder** list, select a folder in which to place the mailing. <!-- Fix reuse ID=a3 -->
    It is always a good idea to define a well-organised folder structure to get a better overview of your mailings, forms, templates, links and images in SuperOffice Marketing. You can create sub-folders in all folders, and you can place the appropriate mailings, forms, templates, links and images in each of these folders.

    To create a new folder:

    1. Select one of the main tabs in SuperOffice Marketing.
    2. Optional: Open an existing folder to create a sub-folder. You may have to click the **All ...** button first.
    3. Click the ![icon](media/btn-addfolder.png)**Add folder** button. The **Folder properties** dialog appears.
    4. Enter a descriptive name for the folder in the **Name** field.
    5. Click **OK**. If the folder does not display in the list, click the **My ...** or **All ...** button.
6. In the **Selection** and **Project** fields, you can associate the mailing with a selection and/or a project. <!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->  
    <!-- Fix reuse ID=a2 -->

7. **Attachments**: To add one or more attachments to the mailing, use one of the following methods:
    * Click **Upload files (or drag here)** to browse to and add a file from a disk or server.
    * Drag and drop a file from Windows Explorer to the attachments field.
    * Click **Choose a CRM document** to select a document in SuperOffice CRM.
8. Under **Tracking** are the following options:
