# Step 1: Setup - E-mail

The first step in creating an e-mail mailing, is called **Setup**. Here you can set the e-mail header information such as sender, reply-to address and subject. You can also add attachments, set archive options for the mailing and select tracking options.

[!include[To do this](../../includes/to-do-this.md)]

1. Enter a name in the **Name of mailing** field.
2. Enter the subject of the e-mail in the **E-mail subject** field.
3. In the **From** list, select **Always use** and enter the sender's e-mail address in the field below to use the same sender for all mailings. You can also choose a sales contact or support contact as the sender, if one is defined for this recipient. Enter an e-mail address to be used if no sales contact or support contact is available.
4. In the **Reply to** list, you have the same options as above. In addition, you can select **Use "From" as reply address**. Any replies will then be sent to the sender.
5. In the **Folder** list, select a folder in which to place the mailing. <!-- Fix reuse ID=a3 -->

    [!include[How to create a mailing folder](../includes/create-mailing-folder.md)]

6. In the **Selection** and **Project** fields, you can associate the mailing with a selection and/or a project. <!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 --> If you add a selection, any contacts in the selection will be added as recipients in the mailing. See [Step 4: Recipients][1].
    <!-- Fix reuse ID=a2 -->

    [!include[Start typing to search](../includes/type-to-search.md)]

7. In the **Type** list, select the type of mailing you are creating. Select **(Any)** if the mailing matches two or more of the available types. Use **(Any)** when you have added multiple recipients with multiple subscriptions and you want to send the mailing to all of them.
8. **Attachments**: To add one or more attachments to the mailing, use one of the following methods:
    * Click **Upload files (or drag here)** to browse to and add a file from a disk or server.
    * Drag and drop a file from Windows Explorer to the attachments field.
    * Click **Choose a CRM document** to select a document in SuperOffice CRM.
9. Under **Tracking** are the following options:
