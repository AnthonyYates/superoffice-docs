# Create a quote

To create a quote:

1. Create a new sale (see [Create a sale][1]).
    or
    Open an existing sale (one which is not sold or lost).

2. Go to the **Quote** section tab.

3. Click **Create a new quote** or **Copy quote from another sale**. The **Edit quote** dialog appears.

    <!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->
    [!include[Select ERP connection](../includes/quote-select-erp.md)]

You can now start adding products to the quote. See [Add/edit a product in the quote][2].
