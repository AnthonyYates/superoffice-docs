# Archive incoming email

You can archive an incoming email (including any attachments) as a document in SuperOffice CRM. This is a convenient way of storing information you have received via email together with other company/contact information in SuperOffice CRM.

In order to do so:

1. Go to the inbox or the relevant folder.
2. Select the required message.
3. Click **Archive** ![icon][img1].
4. Click **Archive email**. The **Document** dialog opens. See [The Document dialog][1].

<!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->

This can mean one of the following:

* The sender's email address is not registered in SuperOffice CRM. To add the sender to SuperOffice CRM, see [Add email addresses in SuperOffice CRM][2].
* The sender's email address is registered on more than one contact or company in SuperOffice CRM. Select the correct contact under **This contact could be**.

If you do not want to register this email address in SuperOffice CRM, click **Do not add contact to SuperOffice** to go to the **Document** dialog.
