# Create task

This feature allows you to quickly add a task in SuperOffice CRM based on the sender and the text content in the email message.

In order to do so:

1. Go to the inbox.
2. Select the required message in the inbox.
3. Click **Archive** ![icon][img1].
4. Click **Create task**. The **Task** dialog opens. [!include[See Appointment dialog](../../includes/see-apt-dialog.md)]

<!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->

This can mean one of the following:

* The sender's email address is not registered in SuperOffice CRM. To add the sender to SuperOffice CRM, see [Add email addresses in SuperOffice CRM][2].
* The sender's email address is registered on more than one contact or company in SuperOffice CRM. Select the correct contact under **This contact could be**.

If you do not want to register this email address in SuperOffice CRM, click **Do not add contact to SuperOffice** to go to the **Task** dialog.
