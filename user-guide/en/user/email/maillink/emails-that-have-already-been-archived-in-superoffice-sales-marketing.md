# Emails that have already been archived in SuperOffice CRM

When an email is archived by a user, it is tagged with a unique ID within SuperOffice CRM. This means that next time someone tries to archive the same email, a warning will appear informing them about this; in this way, it is possible to avoid duplicates in the database.

If you open an email that has already been archived, the **Archive email** button ![icon][1] will appear green with a white check-mark. If you hold the mouse pointer over the button, an info box is displayed, telling you when and by whom the email was archived. This presupposes that you have selected the **Check for duplicates when an email is opened** option in the **SuperOffice CRM options** dialog (see [General settings][1]).
