# Not adding an email address to SuperOffice

It is perfectly possible to archive an email/attachment (see [Archiving emails on companies/contacts][1] and [Archiving attachment(s)][2]) or search for a sender (see [Searching for the sender of an email][3]) without adding the email address to SuperOffice CRM.

If the sender of the email or attachment is not listed in SuperOffice CRM, a warning will appear at the top of the **Archive email** dialog: **This sender's email address is not recognised. Click here to update SuperOffice with this email address**. If you do not want to add the email address to SuperOffice CRM, simply do not click the warning.
