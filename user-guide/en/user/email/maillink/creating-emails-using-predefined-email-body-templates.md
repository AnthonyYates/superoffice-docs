# Creating emails using predefined email body templates

When creating an email from SuperOffice CRM, it is also possible to use predefined SuperOffice templates just for the mail body. Follow these steps:

1. Make sure that an email body template is available, and that the **Use SuperOffice email body** option in the **SuperOffice CRM options** dialog is selected (see [General settings][1]).

2. Click the **Email** toolbar button at the bottom of the SuperOffice CRM window. (This also applies if you click an email address in SuperOffice CRM, send an email from the **Contacts** section tab, or reply to/forward an email from the **Activities** section tab.)

3. In the **To** field, enter the email address(es) of the recipient(s). You can also use the **Select recipients** dialog (see [Selecting recipients][2]).

    > [!TIP]
    > If you select several contacts in a list in SuperOffice CRM, and then right-click and select **Send email**, all the contacts are set as recipients of the email.

4. Write the message.

5. Add any attachments you would like to include. You can also add documents from SuperOffice CRM (see [Adding documents from SuperOffice CRM as attachments][3]).

6. Click **Send** to send the message to the specified recipient(s).
