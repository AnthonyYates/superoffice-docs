# Handling emails from senders not registered in SuperOffice

When you archive an email or an attachment, or create an activity or request based on an email message, SuperOffice CRM performs a search to see if the sender matches any of the recorded companies or contacts. If the sender of the email is not found in SuperOffice, you can add the sender's email address to an existing contact, or create a new contact in a new or existing company.

> [!NOTE]
> This procedure also applies to outgoing emails where the email address of a recipient is not registered in SuperOffice.

Follow these steps:

1. Process the email or attachment as described in one of these topics:
    * [Archive incoming email][3]
    * [Archive outgoing email][4]
    * [Archive attachments][7]
    * [Create activity][5]
    * [Create request][6]
2. If the sender of the email or attachment is not listed in SuperOffice CRM, a warning will appear at the top of the dialog for archiving email. Click the warning. The dialog **Add email address to SuperOffice** opens.
3. Here you have the following options:
    * **Could it be one of these?** SuperOffice will try to match the sender with existing contacts in the database. Click one of the suggested contacts if it matches the sender.
    * Search: Search for a company or contact to which you want to add the sender's email address.
    * **Create new company and contact**: Click this button if the sender is a new contact from a company not previously registered in SuperOffice. Fill in the relevant fields and click **Save**.
4. Click **Save**.

When you return from the dialog **Add email address to SuperOffice**, the company and contact is filled in and the warning is removed.

> [!NOTE]
> If you do not want to add the email address to SuperOffice, you can manually select a company and contact.
