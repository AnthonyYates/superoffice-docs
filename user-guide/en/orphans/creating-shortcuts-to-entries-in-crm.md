# Create shortcuts to entries in SuperOffice CRM

You can create shortcuts to an entry in SuperOffice CRM, e.g. a contact, an appointment, a sale or a screen. Other internal users can click this shortcut to get quickly to the entry in question.

The **Copy shortcut** option is available here:

* Main menu on the Top bar
* Right-clicking an item in a section tab
* **Task** menu in dialogs for follow-ups and documents

When you select the **Copy shortcut** option, a shortcut (URL) to the current entry is then copied to the clipboard. You can then paste the shortcut into, for example, an e-mail message and send it to one or more internal users of SuperOffice CRM. You can also paste the shortcut to the **Run** dialog in Windows to run it.

This function uses the SOProtocol. SuperOffice Web Tools must be installed for this to function properly.
