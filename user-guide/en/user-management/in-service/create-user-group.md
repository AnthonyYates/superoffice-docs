# Create user groups

To create a new user group in Service:

1. Select ![icon][img1] **System settings > Users**.
2. Select the **User groups** tab.
3. Click the **New group** button. The **User group** screen opens.
4. Fill in the **Name** and **Description** fields.
5. Select the **Categories** tab. Here you can choose which categories the users in the group will be members of. In this way, you can avoid having to state a category membership manually for every single user.
6. Do as follows:
    1. Select a category in the **New category** field.
    2. Click **Add category** or **Add with subcategories**.
7. Click **OK**. The user group is created.

If you want to assign a user to this group, follow the procedure under [Edit users][1] and select this group in the **Group** field in the **User information** tab (see [User information][2]). If you wish to assign a user to more than one group, go to the tab **Other groups** (see [Other groups][3]).
