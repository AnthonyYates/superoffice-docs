# Users

In the **Users** screen you can add and edit different types of users:

* **Associates**: SuperOffice CRM users (in your company)

* [**Other users**:][1] <!-- onsite--> On this tab, you can add and edit anonymous users and system users.

* **Anonymous users**: Users with limited rights defined by the role for anonymous users (see [Edit rights for anonymous users][4]). Anonymous users can be used, for instance, to provide access to web pages. In this way, salespersons can make relevant information from SuperOffice CRM available on a website that does not require a login, to give customers easy access to it.

* **System users**: [!include[Access rights](includes/def-system-user.md)]

    This user type is intended for integration purposes. The system user can be used to allow processes full access to the SuperOffice database for replicating diaries, for example.

* [**Our companies**:][2] For a person to be registered as a SuperOffice CRM user, this person must be registered with a company displayed in the **Company** list box in the **Users** screen. And for a company to be displayed in the **Company** list box in the **Users** screen, the company must appear on the company list in the **Our companies** tab.

* In the **User licences** tab, you can see how many user licences are in use, and which users are using the various licences.

* In the **User groups** tab, you can see which users belong to the different user groups.

> [!NOTE]
> Changes you make in the **Users** screen do not come into effect until you click **Save** at the bottom of the screen, and confirm that you want to save the changes in the dialog that then appears. If you click **Cancel**, you will lose all changes you have made in this screen since your last save.
