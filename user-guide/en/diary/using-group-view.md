# Use the group view

Once you have chosen other users and resources (see [Create group views][1]), you are returned to the group view. This will now contain the selected users and resources.

If you click on the name of a user or resource, this user or resource becomes the owner of the diary, and you are taken directly to the **Day** tab of this user or resource. To return to your own diary, select your name from the diary owner list (see [View another diary][2]).

## What would you like to do now?

* [Create group views][1]
* [View group views for an entire user group][3]
* [Create appointments for associates][4]
