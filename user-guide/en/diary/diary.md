# Diary

The diary in SuperOffice CRM is used much like a filofax and has separate pages for every day, week and month.

The diary is a useful tool when you want to plan and perform different types of tasks. From the diary, you can view, edit and delete activities. (See [Manage follow-ups in the Diary][1] and [Activities in SuperOffice CRM][2]).

You also get a [list of sales][3] to work on, using the **Sales** section tab in the **Diary** screen.

## What would you like to do now?

* [Navigate in the Diary screen][8]
* [Manage follow-ups in the Diary][9]
* [Select a time zone][7]
