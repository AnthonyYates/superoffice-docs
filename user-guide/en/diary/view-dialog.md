# The New group view dialog

In the **New group view** dialog, you can display users and resources whose diaries you want to see and save the views in the **View** list box with a name of your choosing.

Bring up the **New group view** dialog as follows:

1. Select **Diary** in the Navigator and select the **View** tab.
2. Select ![icon][img1] **Task** at the bottom right of the tab.
3. Select one of the following:
    * **Edit**: Select this option to edit the current view.
        <!-- Fix reuse ID=a11 -->
        You can only make changes in group views you have created yourself. If you are displaying a predefined group view, the **Edit** button will be greyed out to indicate that you cannot change it here. These group views contain all users that have been assigned to the specific groups. This is defined in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.

        If you want to edit and save a predefined group view, select the **Copy** option and save the view with a new name.
    * **New group view:** Select this option to create a new view.
    * **Copy**: Select this option to copy and edit the current view.

The dialog contains the following fields:

Name

The name of the view you are editing. You can change the view's name.

Description

Here you can enter a description of the view.

Select from

* Select **Associates** if you want to add users from your organisation to the view.
* Select **Project** if you want to add project participants from your organisation to the view.
* Select **Resource** if you want to add resources, e.g. conference rooms and projectors, from your organisation to the view.

List box

When you have selected an option for **Select from**, a list box displays below. The contents of this list box will vary depending on what you selected above:

* If you selected **Associates**, a list of user groups in your organisation is displayed. You can also select **All** if you want to display all the users in the organisation.
* If you selected **Project**, the history list of projects is displayed. Here you can also use [FastSearcher][6] or [The History list][5].
* If you selected **Resource**, a list of resources in your organisation is displayed. This list is defined in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance. Select **All** if you want to see all the resources in your organisation.

Left pane

Here you will see a list of available users and/or resources that can be added to the group view. Select the users/resources you require and click the right arrow ( ![icon][img2] ) to add them to the pane on the right.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also select users and resources individually by double-clicking them.

Click **Select all** ( ![icon][img4] ) if you want to select all the users/resources in the list above. Click **Unselect all** ( ![icon][img5] ) to unselect all the users and resources.

Right pane

Displayed here are all the users and resources you have added to the group view. If you want to remove a user or a resource from this list, select it and click the left arrow ( ![icon][img3] ). The users and resources you have chosen will be displayed in the group view in the same order as in the pane on the right. To change this order, select a user or resource and click arrow up ( ![icon][img6] ) or arrow down ( ![icon][img7] ) to move it up or down.
