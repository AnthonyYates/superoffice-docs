There are two types of activities â€“ documents and follow-ups. Follow-ups is a collective term for appointments, phone calls and tasks. In addition, mailings, form submissions and chat records are displayed in the **Activities** section tab.

The table below illustrates the different kinds of activities:

[!include[ALT](includes/activity-types.md)]

The activities list columns contain the following information:

* ![icon][img1]: The first column in the activities list specifies the **Completed** status of an activity. A tick means that the activity is completed, while an empty box means that it is not completed.
* The Category column contains icons that indicate the type of activity, for example, a telephone for a call. These icons reflect the text in the **Type** column.
* The other columns in the activities list show various information about the activity. If not all the text in a field is visible, hold the mouse pointer over it to display it in a tooltip.

The activities displayed depend on which of the following checkboxes you have selected at the bottom of the section tab:

* Follow-ups (appointments, tasks and phone calls)
* Documents (e-mail, letters, and other documents)
* Mailings (bulk mailings by merged document, e-mail or SMS)
* Other (chat records, form submissions)

You can show all activities, or just one type.

Each type of activity will be dealt with in separate topics and chapters, as follows:

* [Appointment][1]
* [Task][2]
* [Phone Call][3]
* [Work with documents][4]
* [Compose an email][5]
* [Chat][12]
