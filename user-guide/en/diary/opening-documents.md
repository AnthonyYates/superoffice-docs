# Open documents

You can open and view exiting documents from the following locations:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD032 -->
[!include[List of Activities section tabs](includes/list-activities-section-tabs.md)]
* The **Documents** section tab in the **Selection** screen, if a document selection is active.
* The search results in the **Document** tab in the **Find** screen.
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

You can open a document in edit mode or in read mode. When you open the document in edit mode, only you can edit the document. Other users can open the document in read mode. See [Check in/out documents][1].

> [!NOTE]
> If your organisation uses a document library like SharePoint, multiple people can edit a document simultaneously.

The document is opened in the program it was created in.

The procedure depends on how documents are managed in your SuperOffice installation. See [Edit documents][2].
