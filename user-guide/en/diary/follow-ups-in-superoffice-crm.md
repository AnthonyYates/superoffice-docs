# Work with follow-ups

In SuperOffice CRM, follow-ups is a collective term for the appointment, task and phone call activities. These all function in largely the same way.

Each follow-up type will be dealt with separately, as follows:

* [Appointment][1]
* [Task][2]
* [Phone Call][3]

Features which are common to all follow-ups are described below.

> [!TIP]
> In SuperOffice Settings and maintenance, you can define that all follow-ups of a specific type will be displayed in the **Diary** screen in SuperOffice CRM with the same background colour.
