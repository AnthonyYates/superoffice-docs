# Work with project guides

If a project guide has been defined for a project type that you specify for a project, the following happens:

* The first status in the project guide is selected in the **Status** field on the main **Project** card.
* Follow-ups and/or documents for the status are listed on the **Project guide** section tab.

This is how you perform the project:

1. Click the **Create** button in front of the follow-up/document name.

2. In the dialog which appears, you create the follow-up/document in the usual way. Many of the fields are prefilled, but you can change the information, or add more information. See [The Document dialog][1] or [The dialog for follow-ups][2].

    You can delegate the follow-up to your colleagues by setting them as the owner of the follow-up. If defined in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance for a specific follow-up, the **Assign task to project member** dialog appears, where you can select a colleague as the owner of the follow-up.

3. When you have completed the follow-up, check **Completed** in the relevant dialog, or in the checkbox in front of the follow-up name on the **Project guide** section tab. By default, documents are marked as completed.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you want to create several follow-ups of the same type, right-click the activity and select **Create another**. The [follow-ups dialog][2] then opens.

4. Once all the required follow-ups and documents for a project status have been completed, you move on to the next status.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you wish, you can go to the next status without creating or performing all the follow-ups/documents in a status.

5. Repeat the above procedure for all follow-ups/documents in each status of the project guide.

## Move to next status

You can move the project to the next status in two ways:

* To move the project to the next status automatically:

    It can be defined in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance that the project guide should propose moving the project on to the next status when the last follow-up in a status is marked as complete. The **Project guide - move the project to the next status** dialog then opens.

    Click **Yes** to move the project to the next status, or click **No** if you want to continue working on the project within the same status.

* To move the project to the next status manually:

    Right-click the button for the next status in the **Project guide** section tab and select **Move to this status**.

    Or do one of the following on the main **Project** card:

    1. Click **Edit** on the main **Project** card.
    2. Click the arrow next to the **Status** field.
    3. Select the required status from the list that appears. The available options are defined in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.
    4. Click **Save**.
