# Export

Exporting of data from the SuperOffice database is done using the **Selection** or **Reports** screens in SuperOffice CRM. If you want to export a file to import it via the **Import** screen in Windows Client settings, you must export it as an [ANSI file][1]. The import steps for ANSI files is the same as when [importing files][2].
