# Export

Exporting of data from the SuperOffice database is done using the **Selection** or **Reports** screens in SuperOffice CRM. If you want to export a file to import it via the **Import** screen in Windows Client settings, you need to export it as an **ANSI** file (see [ANSI files][1]). The import procedure is the same as described under [Import files][2].
