# Edit items

You can change the name or description of an item previously set up in Settings and maintenance.

> [!NOTE]
> The name of the item will be changed wherever it is already in use in SuperOffice CRM. If you want to avoid this, delete the old item instead and create a new one (see [Delete items][1]).

To edit the name and/or description of an item:

1. [!include[Go to Lists](includes/goto-lists.md)]

2. [!include[Click arrow and select](../../includes/expand-list.md)] the required list.

    All previously defined items for the selected list are displayed in the **Items** list. If you select a new user-defined list, the list will be empty.

3. Double-click the required item in the **Items** list. The **Edit list item** dialog opens.

    <details><summary>Do you want to edit an item in a specialised list?</summary>

    Some list types are more specialised than those referred to in this procedure. For more information, see [Specialised lists][2].
    </details>

4. Type a new name for the item in the **Name** field.

    > [!NOTE]
    > [!include[Mandatory](../../includes/note-mandatory-field.md)]

5. Edit the description of the item, as required, in the **Description** field.

6. [!include[Save or cancel](../../includes/save-or-cancel.md)]
