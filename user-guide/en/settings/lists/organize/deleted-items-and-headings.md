# Deleted items and headings

When you delete items or headings, they are removed from the **Items** and **Headings** lists, and from the relevant lists in SuperOffice CRM.

If records have previously been entered in SuperOffice CRM which refer to the deleted item or the heading, the name will still be displayed in these records, even if the item/heading has been removed from the list it was originally selected from.

Therefore the deletions you make in these tabs are not permanent. You can display items and headings you have deleted by checking **Show deleted items** **and headings**. The deleted elements will then be displayed in the lists, but in red with a strike-through.

If you have deleted an item or a heading and later decide you do not want to remove it from the list in Settings and maintenance, you can undo your deletion in Settings and maintenance as follows:

1. [!include[Go to Lists](../includes/goto-lists.md)]

2. [!include[Click arrow and select](../../../includes/expand-list.md)] the required list.

3. Check **Show deleted items and headings**.

4. Double-click the item or heading you want to undelete (shown in red with strikethrough).

5. Click the **Restore** button.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This button is only available for deleted elements.

6. [!include[Save or cancel](../../../includes/save-or-cancel.md)]

    If you save your changes, the item or heading will then be displayed again in the relevant list in SuperOffice CRM.
