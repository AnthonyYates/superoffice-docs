# Document - Template

[!include[Link to quote template docs](../../includes/learn-quote-templates.md)]

It is important for an organisationâ€™s profile that letters, faxes and other documents have a distinctive and consistent appearance. This means that all documents sent out by the organisation should use the same fonts, margins, logos and so on. By creating templates that are customised to your organisation you ensure that your contacts can easily recognise your correspondence.

SuperOffice CRM is supplied with several standard templates that you can use immediately when you have installed the program (see [Use standard templates][2]).

You can also create your own templates in the applications you have chosen to use in conjunction with SuperOffice CRM (see [GUI - Application][3]). You do this by entering template variables in the template documents (see [Template variables][1]) which then retrieve information from corresponding fields in SuperOffice CRM when you write a document using a template you have created.

Adding a template document involves following steps:

* You need to add and define the document template in Settings and maintenance. See [Add a document template][6].
* You need to make the document template available to the requisite user groups. See [User group filtering][5].

In the sections below there are more details on using standard templates and template variables in SuperOffice CRM, and creating and linking new templates.
