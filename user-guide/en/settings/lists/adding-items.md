# Add items

To add items to both predefined and user-defined lists:

1. [!include[Go to Lists](includes/goto-lists.md)]

2. [!include[Click arrow and select](../../includes/expand-list.md)] the required list from the list box at the top. All previously defined items for the selected list are displayed in the **Items** list. If you select a new user-defined list, the list will be empty.

3. Click the **Add** button below the **Items** list. The **Edit list item** dialog opens.

    <details><summary>Do you want to add an item to a specialised list?</summary>

    Some list types are more specialised than those referred to in this procedure. For more information, see [Specialised lists][1].
    </details>

4. Enter the required name of the item in the **Name** field.

    > [!NOTE]
    > [!include[Mandatory](../../includes/note-mandatory-field.md)]

5. Optionally, type in a description of the item in the **Description** field.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The description you add here will be available as a tooltip when the list is used for a user-defined field.

6. Click **Save**. The item is added to the **Items** list. Repeat this procedure to add more items.

The items are displayed in the order you entered them. To change the order, select an item and move it up or down using the arrow buttons below the list ( ![icon][img3] ![icon][img4] ).

After you have added items, you can specify details for each individual item. You can specify the user groups the item will be visible to (see [User group filtering][2]), and the headings it will display under (see [Headings][3]).
