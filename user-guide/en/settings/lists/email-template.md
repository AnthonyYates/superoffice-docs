# Email - Template

[!include[Link to quote template docs](../../includes/learn-quote-templates.md)]

It is important for an organisationâ€™s profile that emails have a distinctive and consistent appearance. This means that all emails sent out by the organisation should use the same fonts, formatting, logos and so on. By creating email templates that are customised to your organisation you ensure that your contacts can easily recognise your correspondence. Email templates are also used when sending quotes, order confirmations and privacy confirmations.

SuperOffice CRM is supplied with several standard templates that you can use immediately when you have installed the program.

You can also create your own templates. You do this by entering template variables in the email templates (see [Template variables][2]) which then retrieve information from corresponding fields in SuperOffice CRM when you write an email using a template you have created.

Adding an email template involves following steps:

* You need to create the email template in Settings and maintenance. See [Add a document template][3].
* You need to make the email template available to the requisite user groups. See [User group filtering][5].
