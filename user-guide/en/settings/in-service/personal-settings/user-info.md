# User information

In the **User information** tab in the **Edit users** screen, you can edit the following details for your own user profile:

* **User ID**: This is the name you enter when [logging in][1] to the system.

* **Display name**: This is the name visible to other users of SuperOffice Service.

* **First name**, **Middle name** and **Last name**: these comprise your full name.

* **Mobile phone**: This is the mobile number registered for you in the system and which is used to notify you by SMS, if you have SMS notification enabled.

* **Status**: In this list box you can choose between **Normal** and **Not present**. If a user is not present, they will not receive any requests automatically. This is the status you would set, for example, when going on holiday.

* **Out of office message**: Here you enter information to display next to your name in lists of request handlers, for example, when selecting request handlers in the **Owner** field in the **New request** screen.

* **Role**: This is your role. Roles are used as a tool for administrating users. A role has a defined set of properties, for example profiles and functional rights. When you assign a user to a role, the user automatically acquires these properties. You cannot change your own role. See [Roles][2].

* **Group**: This is the user group you belong to. User groups are used to administer which categories users are members of. You can choose a different user group in the list. To join additional groups, see [Other groups][3].

* **New e-mail address**: Here you enter the actual address in the left-hand field and the name of the person in the right-hand one and then click **Apply**.
