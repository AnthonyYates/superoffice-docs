# Sales

**Sales** is one of the section tabs at the bottom of the **Project** screen. It contains information about any sales linked to the project.

The columns of the **Sales** section tab contain the following information:

* ![icon][img1] : The first column in the **Sales** section tab specifies the **Completed** status of a sale. A tick in the checkbox (![icon][img2]) means that the sale is completed, while an empty box means that it is not completed.
* a status icon for the sale, showing whether it is sold ( ![icon][img1] ), lost ( ![icon][img3] ) or stalled ( ![icon][img4] ) (if there is no icon, the sale is "open") (see [Stalled, sold and lost sales][1])
* the date of the sale
* the sale amount
* the current stage of the sale
* the date of the next activity recorded for the sale (the oldest follow-up that has not yet been completed)
* the name of the sale
* the name of the company the sale is linked to
* any contact the sale is linked to

Double-click a sale in the list to open the **Sale** screen in SuperOffice CRM which contains information about that sale. For more details on how to manage sales, see [Sale][2].
