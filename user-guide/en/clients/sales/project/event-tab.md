# The Event tab

This function requires a separate licence (see the SuperOffice Settings and maintenance help).

In the **Event** tab, you can specify settings for publishing events. The tab contains the following fields:

Event

Here you check to indicate that the current project is an event.

Event date

This field shows the date of the event. Click the arrow to select a date for the event.

**Published** (**From date** and **To date**)

Here you can specify a precise time period for when the event is to be visible to Audience users (requires a separate licence). Click the arrow next to each of the date fields to select a start and end date for publishing. If you do not enter dates in these fields, the project will be published all the while it exists in SuperOffice CRM and it is marked as **Publish** (see [Create projects][1]).

**Visible for category:**

Check here if you want the event to be visible only to specific categories. Click the button ( ![icon][img1] ) to the right of the field to select the categories that the event will be visible for.

Visible for contact interest

Check here if you want the event to be visible only to contacts with specific interests. Click the button ( ![icon][img1] ) to the right of the field to select the interests that the event will be visible for.

Visible for project members

If you check here, the event will only be visible in Audience for the project members specified on the **Project members** section tab (see [Project members][2]).

Sign on

Check here if you want it to be possible to sign on to the event through Audience.

> [!TIP]
> If you click the button ( ![icon][img1] ) to the right of **Confirmation**, you can enter a confirmation text that will be displayed in a dialog when an Audience user signs on to the event. The user needs to click **Yes** or **No** in this dialog to continue.

Sign off

Check here if you want it to be possible to sign off from the event through Audience.

> [!TIP]
> If you click the button ( ![icon][img1] ) to the right of **Confirmation**, you can enter a confirmation text that will be displayed in a dialog when an Audience user signs off from the event. The user needs to click **Yes** or **No** in this dialog to continue.

Log as activity

If you also check **Log as activity** next to **Sign on** or **Sign off**, an activity is created for you when an Audience user signs on to or off from the event.
