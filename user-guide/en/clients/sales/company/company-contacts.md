# Contacts

![Contacts section on company -screenshot][img1]

**Contacts** is one of the section tabs at the bottom of the **Company** screen. It contains information about employees of the active company. Double-click on a name in the list to open the contact in the **Contact** screen. See [Contact][1].

## <a id="columns" />Columns in the Contacts section tab

The **Contacts** section tab contains the following columns:

### Information

A paperclip icon ( ![icon][img3] ) in this column means that information has been entered about that contact in **Note** tab in the contact card. Position the mouse pointer over the dot and the information is displayed in a tooltip.

### Interests

A pin icon ( ![icon][img2] ) in this column means that one or more interests have been entered for that contact. Position the mouse pointer over the dot and the information is displayed in a tooltip. To edit the interests, double-click the contact's name to open the contact card, and go to the **Interests** tab. See [Create new contact][2].

### Mr/Ms

Shows how the contact should be addressed.

### First Name/Middle Name/Last Name/Title/Mobile phone

Displays the contact's name, title and mobile phone number.

> [!NOTE]
> Use of middle names is a preference which can be enabled in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance. If the preference is enabled, the middle name is taken to be the first part of the last name (but is not sorted on). If the preference is not enabled, you may enter a middle name in the **First name** field, and the middle name will then be considered as a second first name.

### Email

Displays the contact's e-mail address. Click on the e-mail address to send a message to this person. This opens the message in the e-mail program you have specified. See [Send e-mail to contacts][7].

### Former employees

If you check this option, people who have left the company will also be displayed in the list of contacts.

They will then be shown in a different color. They are also shown in this way on the **Project members** section tab in the **Project** screen and in the list of members in the **Selection** screen.
