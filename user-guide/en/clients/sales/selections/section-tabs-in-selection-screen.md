# Tabs in the Selection screen

The **Selection** screen contains the following section tabs:

| Tab | Description |
|---|---|
|  [The list of members][1] | All selection types except **Company/contact** will have two tabs containing selection data. Selection members can be projects, sales, documents, requests, follow-ups, form submissions, chat conversations, mailings or products. |
| [Company/contact][2] | The **Company/contact** tab contains companies and contacts linked to list of members. Example: All contacts or companies linked to the sales in a selection. |
| [Criteria][3] | Here you can edit the criteria for a dynamic selection. |
| [Details][4] | Here you can edit general information for a selection. |
| [Charts][5] | Here you can view the selection data in a chart. Charts of selections can also be used in [dashboards][6]. |
| [Mailings][7] | Here you can create a mailing to contacts in a selection. You can also see the mailings that have been archived on this selection. |

> [!TIP]
> Click ![icon][img3] on the far right of the column headers in a selection. Here you can group and filter records, and add/remove columns. These settings can be saved for the active selection by selecting **Save columns for current selection only**. See also [The section tabs][11] for additional functions.

To move backwards and forwards between selections:

* Click the previous/next buttons ( ![icon][img2] ![icon][img1] ) at the top right of the screen
