# The Diary screen

The **Diary** screen consists of two main sections:

* A calendar showing follow-ups that have been allocated to a particular time or date.
* A section tab area, which comprises the [activities list][6] and the [sales list][7].

At the bottom left of the calendar is a field for selecting a [time zone][12], if time zones have been enabled in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.

## Tabs in the Diary screen

The diary consists of four different tabs which you can select simply by clicking them at the top of the **Diary** screen.

* [The Day tab][2]
* [The Week tab][3]
* [The Month tab][4]
* [The View tab][5]

Click the word **Diary** in the Navigator and select a time period from the list that appears.

You can [create, edit, move, and delete follow-ups][13] directly in these tabs. Click and drag a follow-up to reschedule it.

Follow-ups with times are displayed as boxes in the different views in the **Diary** screen, with information about the company and the type of follow-up. The following icons are also displayed:

| Icon | Description | Read more |
|:-:|---|---|
| ![icon][img1] | Means that this is a repeating follow-up. | [Create repeating follow-ups][11] |
| ![icon][img2] | Means that the follow-up has several participants. | [Invite your associates to a follow-up][12] |
| ![icon][img3] | Means that the follow-up has been completed. | [Change Completed status of an activity][8] |
| ![icon][img4] | Means that the follow-up has an active alarm. | |
| ![icon][img5] | Means that there are unanswered invitations for this follow-up. | [Status of invitations][9] |
| ![icon][img6] | Means that this follow-up is a video meeting. To join the meeting, right-click the follow-up and select **Join meeting**. | [Work with video meetings][10] |

By default, the follow-ups are displayed as a blue field in the diary tabs. If you hold the mouse pointer over one of these fields, a tooltip is displayed showing more information about the follow-up. You can also double-click the blue field to open the follow-up.

> [!NOTE]
> In SuperOffice Settings and maintenance, you can define that all follow-ups of a specific type will be displayed in the **Diary** screen in SuperOffice CRM with a different background colour from the usual blue.

## Section tabs in the Diary screen

The **Diary** screen contains the following section tabs:

* [Activities][6]: The **Activities** section tab gives you an overview of activities and acts as a to-do list or task list.

* [Sales][7]: The **Sales** section tab shows essential information about sales.
