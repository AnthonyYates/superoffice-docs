# The Reports screen

The **Reports** screen consists of the following tabs. **Favourites**, **Company/contact**, **Project**, **Sale**, **Activity** and **Selection**.

> [!TIP]
> You can go directly to a specific tab in the **Reports** screen by clicking the word **Reports** next to the **Reports** button in the Navigator and then selecting from the list.

Each tab consists of the following:

* A report list showing available reports. This list is always at the top left of the screen.In the **Favourites** tab, this list shows the favourite reports, while in the other tabs, it shows all published reports. See [Report list][6] for more information.

* A report description to make it easy to find out information about the selected report. If the report is on your favourites list, you can amend this description.

* A thumbnail of the report. [The thumbnail][1] is located on the far right of the **Reports** screen and indicates the selected report type: label, list, group list, cross table, calendar or text export.

* A criteria list where you can add, edit and delete criteria and display the criterion/criteria specified for the report. (See [Criteria list][4] and [Search criteria for reports][3].)

* A **Documents** section tab containing a list of saved reports. (See [The report archive (Documents)][5].)
