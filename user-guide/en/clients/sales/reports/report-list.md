# Report list

The report list is at the top left of the **Reports** screen and contains a list of standard reports in the tab you have selected. If you select the **Favourites** tab, your favourite reports appear here. The content of the report description and [the criteria list][1] changes according to what you select in the report list.

> [!TIP]
> If you have selected the **Favourites** report category, you can edit the name and description of these reports by double-clicking a report, or selecting it and clicking **Edit**. To delete a favourite report, select it and click **Delete**.

For more information on managing reports, see [Show report properties][2].
