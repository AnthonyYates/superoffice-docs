# Sales

The **Sales** section tab shows sales connected to the contact.

[!include[Contents of the Sales section tab](../includes/sales-tab.md)]

> [!TIP]
> You can configure the columns on the section tab to display just the information that interests you. See [Configure columns][4].

Double-click a sale in the list to open the **Sale** screen in SuperOffice CRM which contains information about that sale.

Click **Add** to create a new sale. For more details on how to manage sales, see [Sale][1].

Click the **Filter** button ( ![icon][img1] ) to [filter the list][3] by date, users or groups.

If you check **Include stakeholders** at the bottom of the section tab, sales where the contact is involved as a stakeholder are also displayed. See [Stakeholders][2].
