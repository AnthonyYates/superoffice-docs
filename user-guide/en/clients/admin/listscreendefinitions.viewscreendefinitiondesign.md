# Design screen

In this screen you can double-click the required option on the toolbar on the right to create an element. Each element has a rectangular "handle" which you can click to display a menu, which lets you, for example, move the element or add the element type which is selected on the toolbar. Many of the elements contain sample data when they are inserted, to illustrate the appearance they will have when the screen is run.

* **List mode**: Click here to list all the screen elements in a list, as opposed to design mode.
