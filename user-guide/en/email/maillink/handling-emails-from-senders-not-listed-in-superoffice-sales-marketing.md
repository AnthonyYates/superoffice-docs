# Handling emails from senders not listed in SuperOffice

When you archive an email or an attachment, SuperOffice CRM performs a search to see if the sender matches any of the recorded companies or contacts. If the sender is not listed in SuperOffice CRM at all, you will be given the option of adding their email address to SuperOffice CRM.

Follow these steps:

1. Archive the email or attachment as described in one of these topics:
    * [Archiving emails on companies/contacts][1]
    * [Archiving emails as activities][2]
    * [Archiving attachments][3]
2. If the sender of the email or attachment is not listed in SuperOffice CRM, a warning will appear at the top of the dialog for archiving email when you attempt to archive: **This sender's email address is not recognised. Click here to update SuperOffice with this email address**. Click the warning.
3. In the **Save email address** dialog, select one of the following radio buttons:
    * **Create new contact**: Click this option if you want to add the email address to a new contact. See [Adding an email address to a new contact][4].
    * **Add email address to existing contact**: Click this option if you want to add the email address to an existing contact. See [Adding an email address to an existing contact][5].
4. Click **OK**. The contact and their email address will be displayed on the **Contacts** section tab of the specified company card.

> [!NOTE]
> If you attempt to archive more than one email at a time, you will be prompted for each sender not listed in SuperOffice CRM.
