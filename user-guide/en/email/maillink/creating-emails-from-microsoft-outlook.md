# Creating emails from Microsoft Outlook

There are basically two ways of creating an email from Microsoft Outlook. You can use SuperOffice templates (see [Creating emails from Microsoft Outlook using SuperOffice templates][1]), or you can use standard Outlook functionality. Follow these steps:

1. Click the ****New** email** button on the Microsoft Outlook toolbar. A new email window opens.

2. In the **To** field, enter the email address(es) of the recipient(s). You can also use the **Select recipients** dialog (see [Selecting recipients][2]).

3. Write the message.

4. Add any attachments you would like to include. You can also add documents from SuperOffice CRM (see [Adding documents from SuperOffice CRM as attachments][3]).

5. Click **Send** to send the message to the specified recipient(s).
