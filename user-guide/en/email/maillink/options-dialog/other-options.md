# General settings

These options appear in the **General settings** pane of the **SuperOffice CRM options** dialog (see [SuperOffice CRM options dialog][1]).

**Actions when archiving an email:**

These options determine how SuperOffice CRM and the mail client behave in response to various operations.

**Close email after archiving to SuperOffice CRM:**

Check this box if you want the email window in the mail client to close automatically after you have archived the email to SuperOffice CRM.

Delete the email after it has been archived to SuperOffice CRM

Check this box if you want to remove the selected emails from the mail client inbox after they have been archived in SuperOffice CRM. The emails will be moved to the **Deleted items** folder. Please note that if the sender of the email is not listed as a company/contact in SuperOffice CRM, the email(s) will still be moved to the **Deleted items** folder.

Settings for new emails:

These options are used for selecting which email body to use.

Use SuperOffice email body

You can predefine an email body that uses data from SuperOffice CRM. In order to use this template, you need to select this option.

Use default body from email client

If you would like to use the default body from the mail client, you may select this option.

**Warnings:**

These options determine when you receive warnings.

Warn me when an email is larger than (in KB):

If you check this box, you will receive a warning whenever you try to archive an email or attachment larger than a given size. Enter the size (in KB) in the field to the right.

Check for duplicates when an email is opened

If you check this box and open an email that has already been archived, the **Archive email** button will appear green with a white check-mark. If you hold the mouse pointer over the button, an info box is displayed, telling you when and by whom the email was archived. (See [Emails that have already been archived in SuperOffice CRM][2].)
