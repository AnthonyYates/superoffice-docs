# Creating emails from SuperOffice CRM

There are basically two ways of creating an email from SuperOffice CRM. You can use the **Email** toolbar button at the bottom of the SuperOffice CRM window. This works more or less the same way as described in [Creating emails from Microsoft Outlook][1] or [Creating emails from Lotus Notes][2], apart from the fact that you can use predefined email body templates (see [Creating emails using predefined email body templates][3]).

You can, however, also use the **Write** toolbar button. Follow these steps:

1. Click the **Write** toolbar button at the bottom of the SuperOffice CRM window. The **Document** dialog opens.
2. In the **Type** field at the top of the dialog, select an email template.
3. Complete the remaining fields with the required information. Please refer to the User's Guide for more information on this dialog.
4. Click the **Create** button to open the new email in your default mail client.
5. If SuperOffice CRM contains an email address for the company/contact you have chosen in the **Document** dialog, this address is inserted automatically in the messageâ€™s **To** field.  
    Enter the email addresses of any other recipients you would like to add. You can also use the **Select recipients** dialog (see [Selecting recipients][4]).
6. Write the message.
7. Add any attachments you would like to include. You can also add documents from SuperOffice CRM (see [Adding documents from SuperOffice CRM as attachments][5]).
8. Click **Send** to send the message to the specified recipient(s).
