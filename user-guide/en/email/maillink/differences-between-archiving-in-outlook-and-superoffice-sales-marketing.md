# Differences between archiving in Outlook, Notes and SuperOffice CRM

You can create emails in several different ways, both from Outlook (see [Creating emails from Microsoft Outlook][1]), from Notes (see [Creating emails from Lotus Notes][2]) and from SuperOffice CRM (see [Creating emails from SuperOffice CRM][3]). If the **Document** dialog appears, the email will be treated as a SuperOffice document and be archived. If the **Document** dialog does not appear, then whether the email is archived or not depends on the settings in the **SuperOffice CRM options** dialog. This is explained in more detail below.

The **Document** dialog will open automatically if you:

* Click the **Write** button in SuperOffice CRM.

* Click the down arrow to the right of the ****New** email** button on the Microsoft Outlook toolbar and select one of the templates on the **SuperOffice message** submenu.

The **Document** dialog will not open automatically if you:

* Click the ****New** email** button in the mail client. The emails will, however, be archived if the **Archive email by default when: created from email client** option in the **SuperOffice CRM options** dialog is selected (see [Archive options][4]).

* Click the **Email** button in SuperOffice CRM. The emails will, however, be archived if the **Archive email by default when: created from SuperOffice CRM** option in the **SuperOffice CRM options** dialog is selected (see [Archive options][4]).

* When you create an email using the **Email** button in SuperOffice CRM, it is possible to use a predefined email body template by default if the **Use SuperOffice email body** option in the **SuperOffice CRM options** dialog is selected (see [General settings][5]). You can read more about this in [Creating emails using predefined email body templates][6].

> [!NOTE]
> This also applies if you click an email address in SuperOffice CRM, send an email from the **Contacts** section tab, or reply to/forward an email from the **Activities** section tab.
