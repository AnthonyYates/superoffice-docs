# Turning default archiving on/off

If you want to archive all emails you send from your mail client in SuperOffice CRM, you can enable the archive by default function by selecting from the options under **Archive email by default when:** in the **SuperOffice CRM** **options** dialog. (See [Archive options][1].) All emails you send will then be archived to SuperOffice CRM by default.

Click the **Archive is ON/OFF** button in the new email window to enable/disable the archive by default function for emails created in your mail client.
