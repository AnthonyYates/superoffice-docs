# The first time you log in

To access email, you need to specify some details about your email account. The **Set up email account** screen appears the first time you open your inbox.

To enter the required information in this window:

1. In the **Email account** field, enter the email address of the account you want to use in SuperOffice.
2. If you want to enter information for incoming and outgoing email, click **Advanced settings**. If not, click **Next**. SuperOffice will then try to set up this information for you.
3. In the **Password** field, enter your password.
4. Click **Log in**. If SuperOffice recognizes the email provider (such as Gmail), the server settings will be set up automatically and the inbox will load. If not, the settings screen will display and you must fill in the required fields.

## Why is the e-mail list is not updated?

Some email providers, such as Gmail, will block login attempts from unknown apps. Check your inbox to see if your email provider has sent you information about an unauthorized login attempt. Follow the instructions in the email to allow SuperOffice to access your account.
