# Archive emails

## <a id="incoming" />Archive incoming email

You can archive an incoming email (including any attachments) as a document in SuperOffice CRM. This is a convenient way of storing information you have received via email together with other company/contact information in SuperOffice CRM.

1. Go to the inbox or the relevant folder.
2. Select the required message.
3. Click **Archive** ![icon][img1].
4. Click **Archive email**. The **Document** dialog opens. See [The Document dialog][1].

## <a id="outgoing" />Archive outgoing email

To send a message and archive it as a document in SuperOffice CRM, click **Send and archive** when you are writing an email message. See [Compose an email][3].

> [!TIP]
> If you do not archive the message when you send it, you can still go to the sent folder and archive the message as described above.

## <a id="attachments" />Archive or open attachments

To open an attachment or archive an attachment in SuperOffice:

1. Go to the inbox.
2. Select the required message in the inbox. Attachments are displayed under the mail header, displaying the name and file type icon (if recognized).
3. Click the arrow on the attachment you want to save or open.
4. Select one of the following options:
    * **Open**: The attached file is displayed in your browser. Click the attachment to open it or to save it. How this works, depends on the browser.

## Troubleshooting

### The Add contact to SuperOffice dialog opens

This can mean one of the following:

* The sender's email address is not registered in SuperOffice CRM. To add the sender to SuperOffice CRM, see [Add email addresses in SuperOffice CRM][2].
* The sender's email address is registered on more than one contact or company in SuperOffice CRM. Select the correct contact under **This contact could be**.

If you do not want to register this email address in SuperOffice CRM, click **Do not add contact to SuperOffice** to go to the **Document** dialog.
