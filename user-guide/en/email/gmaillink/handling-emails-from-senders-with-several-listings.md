# Handling emails from senders with several listings

When you archive an email or an attachment, or create an activity based on an email, SuperOffice CRM performs a search to see if the email address matches any of the recorded companies or contacts. If the email address is listed more than once in SuperOffice CRM, a warning displays in the dialog **Archive email in SuperOffice**. Click the warning to select the correct contact.
