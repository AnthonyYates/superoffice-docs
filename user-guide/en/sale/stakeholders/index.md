# Stakeholders

![icon][img1]

A sale has a main contact, but partners and subcontractors may also be involved in the sale. These are referred to as stakeholders and can be entered in the **Stakeholders** section tab at the bottom of the **Sale** screen. Stakeholders can include individuals as well as organisations.

For each stakeholder, information about company, contact name, role in the sale, e-mail address and telephone number is displayed.

A sale has a main contact, but partners and subcontractors may also be involved in the sale. These are referred to as stakeholders and can be entered in the **Stakeholders** section tab at the bottom of the **Sale** screen in SuperOffice CRM. Stakeholders can include individuals as well as organisations.

For each stakeholder, their role in the sale is shown. These sales roles are defined in the **Lists** screen in Settings and maintenance.

> [!NOTE]
> For the **Stakeholders** section tab to show in the **Sale** screen in SuperOffice CRM, **This sale type has stakeholders** must be checked in the **Edit list item** dialog for the **Sale - Sale type (for stages)** list.

You also need to set the **Enable Stakeholders** preference in the **Sale** preference group.
