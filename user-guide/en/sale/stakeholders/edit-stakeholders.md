# Edit or remove stakeholders

You can edit the details in the **Sales role** and **Comment** field for stakeholders.

You do this as follows:

1. Go to the required sale in the **Sale** screen. (See [Use the Find screen][1].)
2. Select the **Stakeholders** section tab.
3. Select one or more stakeholders, and click **Edit** ( ![icon][img1] ) at the bottom of the section tab. The **Edit stakeholder** dialog opens.
4. Select the stakeholders you want to edit.
5. Make the required changes in the **Sales role** and **Comments** fields. There is a description of the different fields under [Create stakeholders][2].

> [!TIP]
> You can select multiple companies/contacts by holding down **CTRL** or **SHIFT** as you select. Changes you then make in the **Sales role** field and **Comment** text box will apply to all the selected companies/contacts.

1. Click **OK** to close the dialog and save the changes.

> [!NOTE]
> Click **Cancel** to exit edit mode without saving your changes.

To remove one or more stakeholders from the sale, select them and click the **Remove** button below the section tab. In the dialog that appears, click **Yes**.
