# Add alternatives to a quote

You can add several alternatives to a quote, so that the customer can choose the most suitable one. Each alternative can contain different products, numbers of products, prices and discounts. You also have the option to include only one alternative in the quote.

Alternatives are shown as tabs in the quote (in the **Edit quote** dialog).

## To create an alternative

1. Open an existing quote, or [create a new quote][1].

2. If you haven't already done so, [add products][2] in the **Products** tab.

3. Click the **+** (plus sign) tab in the **Edit quote** dialog.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If this tab is not displayed, alternatives are not enabled for the sales type of the current sale. You can select a different sales type, or enable alternatives for this sales type in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.

4. In the **Name** field, enter the name of the alternative. This will be the name of the tab for this new alternative.

5. Select one of the following:
    * **Create new alternative**: Creates a new alternative without products.
    * **Copy alternative**: You can copy and edit the existing quote (with associated products) as a new alternative. Select the alternative you want to copy from the list on the right.

6. Click **Add** when you have finished. The new alternative is added as a new tab in the quote.

7. If you want to change the name of the **Products** tab to something describing this alternative, double-click the name of the tab.

## Favourite alternative

If you have created several alternatives in a quote, the first one (usually the **Products** tab) is marked as the favourite ( ![icon][img2]**Favourite alternative**). Estimated sales amounts for the sale (forecast) are obtained from the total amount for the favourite alternative.

If you want another alternative to be the favourite, select its tab, and click ![icon][img3] **Favourite alternative** at the bottom.

When sending the quote, you can select to only include the favourite alternative.

## Delete alternatives

You can delete an alternative by selecting ![icon][img1] **Task** > **Delete \[alternative\]** at the bottom of the tab.
