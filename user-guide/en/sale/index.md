# Sale

The sale function in SuperOffice CRM enables you to record sales, keep track of costs and profits for every sale, and link sales to projects. The **Sale** screen contains information recorded about the sales entered in SuperOffice CRM.

You can also [create a quote][1] in the **Quote** section tab in the **Sale** screen.

In addition to the **Sale** screen, sales can be displayed in the following places in SuperOffice CRM:

* On the **Sales** section tab in the **Company** screen.
* On the **Sales** section tab in the **Contact** screen.
* On the **Sales** section tab in the **Diary** screen. See [The Sales secretary][2].
* On the **Sales** section tab in the **Project** screen.

> [!TIP]
> If you double-click a sale in one of these locations, the sale opens in the **Sale** screen.

If you have selected a sale type for which a sales guide has been defined, the **Sales guide** section tab is displayed. For more information, see [Sales guide][3].

In the **Sale** screen, each sale is displayed like an index card. You can see all the information that has been recorded for a sale.

To move backwards and forwards between sales click the previous/next buttons ( ![icon][img2] ![icon][img1] ) at the bottom right of the cards
