# Delete a sale

You may find that you want to delete a sale, if it is no longer appropriate to store it in the database.

1. Go to the required sale.
2. Click the **Task** button (![icon][img1]).
3. Select **Delete 'sale name'**.
4. When you are asked if you really want to delete the sale, click **Yes**.

> [!TIP]
> For more details about this, see [Delete items in SuperOffice CRM][1].
