# Sales guide

Using the sales guide, the company can simplify and structure the sales process for its sales staff. The sales guide guides you through the different stages of a predefined sales process and contains suggestions for which follow-up should be performed and which documents created in each stage. It can also suggest the next step in the sales process.

The sales guide is defined in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance. See the **SuperOffice Settings and maintenance help** for instructions.

You can preview documents and activities in the **Preview** view in the side panel.
