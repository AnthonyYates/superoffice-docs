# Quote (section tab in Sale)

In the **Quote** section tab at the bottom of the **Sale** screen, you can display existing quotes or create new ones. The options available to you here depend on whether a quote has been created for the sale, or not.

## Sale without an existing quote

**Create a new quote**: Click here to create a quote for this sale. See [Create a quote][1].

**Copy quote from another sale**: Click here to use an existing quote at the basis for a new quote. See [Copy a quote][2].

## Sale with an existing quote

**Click to create quote document**: See [Create a quote document][3].

Alternatives: If the quote contains one or more [alternatives][4], you can choose one from the list at the top of the **Quote** section tab. The ![icon][img1]/![icon][img2] icons at the bottom of the list indicate whether the selected alternative is the [favourite alternative][5] or not.

On the right of the **Quote** section tab are the version, quote number and [status][6] (for example, **Draft** or **Sold**). Click **Open** to edit the quote. See [the Edit quote dialog][8].

[!include[Table showing quote states](../../sale/quote/includes/table-quote-states.md)]

The product list: If products have been added to the quote, they are shown in the list. At the bottom of the list, the total price of the products in it is displayed. See [Add/edit a product in the quote][7].

**Export**: Click here to export the product list to a spreadsheet.
