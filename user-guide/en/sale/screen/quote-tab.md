# Quote (section tab in Sale)

In the **Quote** section tab at the bottom of the **Sale** screen, you can display existing quotes or create new ones. The available options depend on whether the sale has a quote.

## Sale without an existing quote

**Create a new quote**: Click here to [create a quote][1] for this sale.

**Copy quote from another sale**: Click here to [use an existing quote][2] as the basis for a new quote.

## Sale with an existing quote

**Click to create quote document**: See [Create a quote document][3].

Alternatives: If the quote contains one or more [alternatives][4], you can choose one from the list at the top of the **Quote** section tab. The ![icon][img1]/![icon][img2] icons at the bottom of the list indicate if the selected alternative is the [favourite alternative][5].

On the right of the **Quote** section tab are the version, quote number and [status][6] (for example, **Draft** or **Sold**). Click **Open** to edit the quote.
