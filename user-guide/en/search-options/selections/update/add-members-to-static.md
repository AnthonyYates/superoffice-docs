# Add members to static selections

When you have [created a static selection][1], you can always add additional members to that selection. This can be done from any list containing the relevant records, such as search results and section tabs.

> [!TIP]
> You can also [copy members from another selection][3].

There are simple rules for members of selections.

* Members are always unique, which means that the same record cannot be entered twice in the same selection.

* You cannot enter the same company both with and without a contact. This means that if a company is entered without a contact and you then try to enter it with a contact, the entry without a contact is removed from the selection.

## Add members to an open static selection

You can add new members to an open static selection as follows:

1. Click the **Add members** button below the list of members. The dialog **Add all members matching** opens.

2. Edit the criteria as described in [Use the Find screen][2].

3. Click **OK**. Matching members are added to the selection.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you want to add several records, use **Shift** or **Ctrl** + click.

4. Select **Add to existing static selection**. Specify the required selection by clicking the arrow and selecting the required selection in the displayed list box, or by typing in the whole or the beginning of the selection name.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The list of selections will be limited to the following:
    >
    > * Existing *static* selections (not dynamic selections or combined selections)
    >
    > * Selections matching the records you are adding (if you have selected sales, only selections of sales will be displayed)
    >
    > If the list is empty, there are no existing selections of this type.

5. Click **OK**. The selection is updated.
