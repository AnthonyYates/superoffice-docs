# Favorite reports

In the **Reports** screen you can save reports which you use a lot or have edited. You simply add them to the list of favorite reports. The report list contains the names of the reports and information about the selected report is shown on the right.

> [!NOTE]
> The list is empty until you define some favorite reports.

These favorite reports are in fact standard reports for which you have changed the search criteria. Favorite reports act as shortcuts to the search criteria which you normally use when running reports. For more information about how to make the change the search criteria, see [Edit search criteria in reports][4].

> [!TIP]
> You can bring up the list of favorite reports instantly by clicking the **Favourites** tab in the **Reports** screen, or by clicking the word **Reports** next to the **Reports** button in the Navigator and selecting **Favourites**.
