# View reports

How this works varies slightly from report type to report type. If you want to display cross table reports or label reports, see the topics below:

* [Display cross tables][1]
* [Display labels][2]

> [!TIP]
> If you are not sure which report type you have, check the thumbnail at the top right of the **Reports** screen. For more information about this, see **Report types** under [Show report properties][3].

1. Select the required report.
2. Click the **Preview** button under the criteria list. A PDF is generated in your browser.
3. Open the PDF file. The file is opened in the default PDF viewer.

> [!NOTE]
> If you do not have a PDF viewer, you will be asked if you want to install one.

You can save the PDF file from the PDF viewer, so you can open it later.
