# Create reports

In the **Reports** screen, you can only [run previously defined reports][1]). You cannot define completely new reports.

To save a report as a document (type = Report) in SuperOffice CRM, click the **Save** button in the **Reports** screen. See [Create new documents][4].

You can define new reports in SuperOffice Reporter Studio and import them in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance (**Options** &gt; **Reports**).

However, if you want to create a separate report, you can [alter the search criteria][2] in an existing report and [save it as your own favorite report][3].
