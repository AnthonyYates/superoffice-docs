# Print reports

The procedure for printing reports is the same for lists, group lists, calendars and text export. For labels and cross tables it is slightly different. For more information, see:

* [Print cross tables][1]
* [Print labels][2]

Follow the steps below to print the list, group list, calendar and text export report types.

1. [!include[How to-goto-reports](includes/goto-reports.md)]

2. Select the required report (see [Show report properties][3]).

3. Click the **Preview** button under the criteria list. A PDF is generated in your browser.

4. Open the PDF file. The file is opened in the default PDF viewer.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you do not have a PDF viewer, you will be asked if you want to install one.

5. Click the print button in the PDF viewer.
