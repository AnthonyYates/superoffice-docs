# Copy companies

[!include[Requirement](../includes/note-req-manage-entities.md)]

At some stage, you may want to copy an existing company to a new company. For example: an existing company has set up a new branch. The new branch will use mostly the same company information as the existing one.

> [!NOTE]
> Activities, sales, interests, project membership and selection membership are not copied.

## To copy the company

1. [!include[Go to company](includes/goto-company.md)]

2. Select **Manage companies** from the ![icon][img1] **Task** button, and click **Copy company**.
    The **Copy company** dialog opens. The source company is specified under **From**.

3. Enter the name of the new company and, where appropriate, a department under **To**.

4. Under **Copy contacts with all information**, you can choose from:

    * **Do not copy**. If you select this option, the company details are copied, but not the contacts.
    * **Copy**. If you select this option, the company details and the contacts are copied.

    [!include[Preview results](../includes/note-preview-results.md)]

5. Click **Copy**. The new company is created with the specified information, and is given its own number and code. You can then [edit the company information][2] if required.
