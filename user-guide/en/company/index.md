# Companies

![Company screen -screenshot][img3]

The **Company** screen contains all your company customers. For each company, you can view the associated contacts in the **Contacts** section tab.

> [!NOTE]
> Contacts that are not associated with a company, can be found in the **Contact** screen. See [Contact][1].

In the **Company** screen, every record in the database is displayed like an index card. A record in a database contains all the information that has been entered for a company.

To move backwards and forwards between companies, click the previous/next buttons ( ![icon][img2] ![icon][img1] ) at the bottom right of the cards

You can search for specific companies based on criteria that you specify. You can also write documents, generate follow-ups and create new companies and contacts.

The bottom of the **Company** screen contains the following default section tabs: **Contacts**, **Relations**, **Projects**, **Activities**, **Sales** and **Requests**. Everything you need to find out about a company is available from a single screen.
