# Access rights to reports

All SuperOffice CRM users have access to the **Reports** screen in SuperOffice CRM, but the individual reports you can access depend on the rights you have in respect of follow-ups, documents, sales and the activities list (see [Role][1]). In practice, this means that you cannot generate reports for content you do not have permission to view in SuperOffice CRM.
