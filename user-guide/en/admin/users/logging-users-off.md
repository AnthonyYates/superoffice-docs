# Log users off

If a user is denied access to SuperOffice CRM, e.g. following a program crash, the administrator can log off the user in Settings and maintenance, so that the user can log in again as normal. To do this:

1. Click the **Users** button in the Navigator (![icon][img1]).
2. Select the **Associates** tab.
3. Select the required company in the **Company** list box.
4. Select **Logged-on to Windows client** in the list box below the list of users.
5. Select the required user in the list of users (see [Users][1]).
6. Click the **Task** button and select **Log user off**. The user is logged off.

> [!NOTE]
> If the user is not logged in or something other than **Logged-on to Windows client** is selected in the **View** list box, this button is disabled.
