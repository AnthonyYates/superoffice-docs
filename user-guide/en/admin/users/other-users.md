On the **Other users** tab in the **Users** screen, you can edit login rights for and add the following user types:

* **Anonymous**: Anonymous users have rights based on the role for anonymous users (see [Edit rights for anonymous users][5]). It is not usually necessary to have more than one anonymous user set up.

<!-- -->

* **System**: System users can log in to the system via third-party applications and have all rights.

## What would you like to do now?
