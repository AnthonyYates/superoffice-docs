# Visibility

Whether you can view specific documents, sales, follow-ups and selections does not depend solely on the role you have been assigned (see [Role](../role/Role.md)). Certain individual items of information may not be available to you. In the documents and follow-ups dialogs and in the **Sale** and **Selection** screens, there is a list box called **Visible for**. In the **Sale** screen, you can, for example, choose to make the sale visible to everyone, visible only to the primary group that the owner belongs to, or visible only to the owner.

This requires the licence **Confidential activities**.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Visible for** list box in the **Selections** screen does not require this licence, and is available to all users.
