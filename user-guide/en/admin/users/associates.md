# Associates

> [!NOTE]
> **Associates** are SuperOffice users in your company (or a related company such as a subsidiary).

In the **Associates** tab in the **Users** screen, you can add users of the type **Associate**, and assign them roles, groups and licences, edit existing users and [delete users][1].

> [!NOTE]
> In the **Users** screen you specify which licences you want different users to have. If you want to add new system licences or increase/reduce the number of licences for one or more modules, you need to contact SuperOffice to update the licence information.

## The associate list

By default, the list in the **Associates** tab consists of the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| User ID | The user name assigned to the associate. |
| First name | The user’s first name. |
| Last name | The user’s last name. |
| Primary group | The primary group of the user. |
| Role | The [role][7] assigned to the user. The role determines the user's access rights to data in SuperOffice CRM. |
| User plan | The user plan assigned to the user, |
| Owning company | The name of the organisation the user belongs to (defined as database owner). |

> [!TIP]
> You can select which columns to display in the list. Just right-click a column heading, and select the relevant columns in the columns list. To change the order of the columns, click and drag a column heading.

### Filter the list

If the list of associates contains many users, you can [filter and group the list][6] to make it more manageable.

## User information

On the right-hand side of the window, there is detailed information about the user selected in the list of associates.

The full name, e-mail address and owning company is displayed at the top. At the bottom of this section, you can activate/deactivate the user in SuperOffice using the **Can log in** button. Click the **Task** button to access functions such as **Move user** and for sending welcome e-mails and e-mails for resetting passwords.

* In the **Detail** tab you can [edit user information][2] such as user name, role, user plan and groups.
* In the **Licences** tab, you can select licences in addition to those defined by the selected user plan.
