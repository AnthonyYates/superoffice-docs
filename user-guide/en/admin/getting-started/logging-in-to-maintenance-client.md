# Log in to Settings and maintenance

When you start Settings and maintenance, you will see a login screen where you must enter a user ID and password to open the program.

* Enter your user ID and password and click **OK**.

<!-- onsite-->
> [!NOTE]
> The first time you run Settings and maintenance, a dialog displays an amendment to the Terms of Service. Please read this important information and click **Accept** and **OK** to continue using Settings and maintenance. This dialog will not be displayed again, but you can read the complete text here: [Addendum to SuperOffice Software Maintenance Agreement][1].

You need to belong to the **User level 0** role or another role that gives you login rights for Settings and maintenance. User IDs, passwords and user levels are all defined in the [**Users** screen][2].

> [!TIP]
> You can also open Settings and maintenance via **Settings and maintenance** on the **File** menu in SuperOffice CRM for Windows, or from the main menu in SuperOffice CRM for Web.
