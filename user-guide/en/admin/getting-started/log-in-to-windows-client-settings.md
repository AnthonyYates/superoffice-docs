# Log in to Windows Client settings

Windows Client settings can be opened from the **Start** menu in Windows or directly from Windows Explorer.

You need to belong to the **User level 0** role or another role that gives you login rights for Windows Client settings. User IDs, passwords and user levels are all defined in the **Users** screen in Settings and maintenance

The Windows Client login is required even if you are already logged in to SuperOffice CRM on the same PC.
