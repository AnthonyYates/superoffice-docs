# Settings and maintenance

Settings and maintenance is the web-based administration client for SuperOffice CRM.

Settings and maintenance cannot be used for Satellite, only for the central database.

Certain features like replication, Travel, Satellite, import and scripting are only available from the Windows-based administration client ([Windows Client settings][1]).
