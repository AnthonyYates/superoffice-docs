# Sale - Stakeholder role

A sale has a main contact, but partners and subcontractors may also be involved in the sale. These are referred to as stakeholders and can be entered in the **Stakeholders** section tab at the bottom of the **Sale** screen in SuperOffice CRM. Stakeholders can include individuals as well as organisations.

For each stakeholder, their role in the sale is shown. These sales roles are defined in the **Lists** screen in Settings and maintenance.

> [!NOTE]
> In order for the **Stakeholders** section tab to be displayed in the **Sale** screen in SuperOffice CRM, **This sale type has stakeholders** must be checked in the **Edit list item** dialog for the **Sale - Sale type (for stages)** list. See [Add items to the Sale - Sale type (for stages) list][1].
You also need to set the **Enable Stakeholders** preference in the **Sale** preference group. See [Add preference settings][3].

You add, edit and delete items in the **Sale - Stakeholder Role** list as described under [Items][2].
