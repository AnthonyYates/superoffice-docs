# Sales guide

In the **Sales guide** tab in the **Workflow** screen in Settings and maintenance, you can design sales guides to guide sales staff through the sales process. A sales guide consists of stages containing follow-ups and documents to guide the sales person through the entire sale. Each sales guide is linked to a sale type, and the sales guide is enabled in the **Sale** screen in SuperOffice CRM when the user creates a new sale or changes the sale type of an existing sale, and selects a sale type that has a sales guide linked to it.

**For example:** The sale type "Sale to new customer" might consist of three stages: "First meeting", "Quotation" and "Contract signing". The "First meeting" stage might, for example, include the "Customer meeting" follow-up (an appointment) and the "Meeting invitation" document (an e-mail). For more details, see [Create a new sales guide](Create-new-sales-guide.md).
