# Chat

The **Chat** feature in SuperOffice allows your support agents and sales people to chat with customers, potential customers and other people via the chat widget/window on your web site. This feature can for instance be used for service/support and pre-sales, and it easily integrates with FAQ, documents/attachments and templates. The chat feature can be set up with multiple chat channels for different topics, such as technical support, product questions and sales support.

Your agents can access chat via the Navigator in both SuperOffice CRM and SuperOffice Service.
