# The Status tab

Updated information about the system is displayed in the **Status** tab in the **Licences** screen. The **Status** screen is divided into the following main sections:

## Database

Shows the database owner, serial number and type, which are specified on installation. It also shows whether it is a central database or a satellite database, for example. You can also see the next expiry date and the name of the user currently logged in.

## Metered services

Click this button to open the dashboard for your metered services.

Metered services are services that are invoiced once you exceed a certain level/number of

* storage space used
* e-mails sent via Mailings
* customer center logins
* chat sessions started
* form submissions

Administrators can keep track of exactly how much of each service has been used per month. Whenever your company exceeds the threshold, youâ€™ll automatically be invoiced for these services on your next monthly invoice. The threshold depends on the number of users. The more users you have, the higher the threshold will be.

## System notifications

This list shows status messages from the system and events that have been added (see below). Notifications of active imports, SAINT or freetext indexing, etc. Select a notification in the list to display a description. See [System events](../chap06/System-events.md).
