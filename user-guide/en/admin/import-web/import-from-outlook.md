# Import from Outlook

[!include[Back up database before import](../includes/caution-backup-before-import.md)]

To import your Outlook companies into the SuperOffice database:

## A. Import companies/contacts from Outlook

1. Open the **Import** screen by clicking the **Import** button in the Navigator ( ![icon](../media/Knapp-Import-liten.bmp) ).
2. Click the Outlook icon ( ![icon](../media/import-outlook-small.bmp) ) under **Select an import source**. Outlook will open and a dialog will be displayed while the export from Outlook is in progress. <!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->
    You must install and configure SuperOffice Web Tools in order to import companies from Outlook. In SuperOffice CRM, go to **File &gt; Download &gt; SuperOffice Web Tools**. Contact user support if you experience problems.

> [!NOTE]
> The companies/contacts from Outlook will not be imported into the SuperOffice database yet. SuperOffice will only upload the company/contact list from Outlook, so that you can specify the import settings.

When the import from Outlook has finished, the companies/contacts will be displayed in the **Import** screen.

## B. Adjust the import
