# Import from Gmail

[!include[Back up database before import](../includes/caution-backup-before-import.md)]

To import your Gmail companies into the SuperOffice database:

## A. Import companies/contacts from Gmail

1. Open the **Import** screen by clicking the **Import** button in the Navigator ( ![icon](../../../media/icons/admin/Knapp-Import-liten.bmp) ).
2. Click the Gmail icon ( ![icon](../../../media/icons/admin/import-gmail-small.bmp) ) under **Select an import source**. What you need to do in the next step depends on whether you are already logged in to Gmail.
3. One of the following dialogs will be displayed:
    * **Request for permission**: If this dialog appears, you are already logged in to Gmail. Click **Give access**.
    * **Google accounts**: If this dialog appears, you are not logged in to Gmail. Type in the user name and password, and log in to Gmail. Click **Give access**.  
        Your Gmail companies will be displayed in Settings and maintenance.

> [!NOTE]
> The companies from Gmail will not be imported into the SuperOffice database yet. SuperOffice will only upload the company list from Gmail, so that you can specify the import settings.

## B. Adjust the import
