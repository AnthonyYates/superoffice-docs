# User groups and page 1 fields

When you select a name in the **User group** list, the available page 1 fields for the selected user group are displayed under **Fields 1**, **2** and **3**.

> [!NOTE]
> User groups are defined in the **Lists** screen, and the group that a user belongs to is defined in the **Users** screen.

If you select **(all user groups)** in the **User group** list, select a field or fields and save the setup, the same selection of fields will apply to all user groups in SuperOffice CRM. If you then select a specific user group, you can override the existing field setup for just this group by using a different specification. If you do not specify anything in a field, it will be left empty â€“ since the override applies to all three fields irrespective of their contents.

> [!NOTE]
> You must publish an override for a single user group *after* you have specified a setup for all user groups. If you don't, it will not take effect.
