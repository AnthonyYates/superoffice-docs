# Add items to the Project - Type, status list

When you add an item to the **Project - Type, status** list, the **Edit list item** dialog is not the same as described under [Add items](Adding-items.md).

To complete the fields in the **Edit list item** dialog when the list items are project types:

1. Enter the name of the item in the **Name** field.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This is a mandatory field and must therefore be filled in.

2. In the **Estimated time for this project process**, enter a duration for the project (number of weeks, days or months). When you create a new project of this project type, the end date will be set relative to the time you enter here (today's date + estimated time).

3. In the **Statuses used for this project type** list, check off the statuses you want to include for the project type. This step is optional, but if you want to link the project type to a project guide, you should check at least two statuses. For more details on how to create statuses, see [Project - Status](Project-Status.md).

4. Check **This project type is linked to a guide** if you want all projects of this project type to follow a [project guide](../Sale/Project.md).

5. If you wish, select **Suggest moving the project to next status automatically**. When all follow-ups and documents for a status have been completed, you will be asked if you want to go to the next status.

6. Enter a description of the project type.

7. Click **Save**. The project type is added as a separate item in the **Items** list. Repeat this procedure to add more project types.
