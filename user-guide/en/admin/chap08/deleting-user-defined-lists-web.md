# Delete user-defined lists

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot delete lists which are predefined in SuperOffice CRM. If you select a predefined list, the **Delete list** button will not be displayed. Nor can you delete lists which are used in user-defined fields. In these cases, the **Delete list** button in the **Lists** tab is disabled.

> [!TIP]
> To quickly go to a list, click **Lists** in the navigator and start typing in the search field ( ![icon](../media/Soek.bmp) ). The search results are updated while you type.

To delete a user-defined list:

1. Click the **Lists** button in the Navigator (![icon](../media/Knapp_Lister_liten.bmp)).
2. Click the arrow (![icon](../media/pil_ned.bmp)) and select the required list from the list box at the top.
3. Click the **Delete list** button.
4. In the dialog which opens, click **Yes** to confirm that you want to delete this list. The list will be deleted.
