# Use standard templates

SuperOffice CRM is supplied with a set of standard templates for both national and international use.

These templates are used when you create documents from SuperOffice CRM. For more information about creating documents, see "Creating new documents" in the help for Standard CRM.

The templates contain variables which extract information from the SuperOffice database and enter it into the document automatically.

You can edit the templates that are supplied with SuperOffice CRM. For more details, see [Edit standard templates](Editing-standard-templates.md).
