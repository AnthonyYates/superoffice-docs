# GUI - Web panel

You can have shortcuts to URL addresses in SuperOffice CRM, so that you can open them directly from within the program.

You define which URL addresses will be available to users in SuperOffice CRM in the **Lists** screen in Settings and maintenance. This is described in the topics below.

The items are displayed in the order you entered them. To change the order, select an item and move it up or down using the arrow buttons to the left of the list ( ![icon](../media/pil_flyttopp.bmp) ![icon](../media/pil_flyttned.bmp) ).

After you have added items, you can specify details for each individual item. You can specify:

* Which user groups the item will be visible for (see [User group filtering](User_groups.md)).
* Which heading it will be displayed under (see [Headings](Headings_web.md)).
