# Create a template document

You create a template as a document in an application which is linked to SuperOffice CRM, for example, a word-processing program. If you create the template in Word, you must save it as a normal document (with the file type **DOC** or **DOCX**), and not as a template (with the file type **DOT** or **DOTX**).

You can also create templates in HTML format, and use the SuperOffice HTML editor to edit the template.

To create a template document:

1. Start the required application.
2. Create a new document.
3. Insert the template variables you want to use in the template, e.g. variables for name, address and telephone number, as described under [Template variables][1].
4. Save the template document somewhere where you will be able to find it easily again.

After you have defined a template and saved it in the template folder, you must link it to SuperOffice CRM in order to be able to use it when you create documents. For more details, see [Add a document template](Adding-a-template-web.md).
