# E-mail - Template

It is important for an organisationâ€™s profile that e-mails have a distinctive and consistent appearance. This means that all e-mails sent out by the organisation should use the same fonts, formatting, logos and so on. By creating e-mail templates that are customised to your organisation you ensure that your contacts can easily recognise your correspondence. E-mail templates are also used when sending quotes, order confirmations and privacy confirmations.

SuperOffice CRM is supplied with several standard templates that you can use immediately when you have installed the program.

You can also create your own templates. You do this by entering template variables in the e-mail templates (see [Template variables](../Template_variables.md)) which then retrieve information from corresponding fields in SuperOffice CRM when you write an e-mail using a template you have created.

Adding an e-mail template involves following steps:

* You need to create the e-mail template in Settings and maintenance. See [Add a document template](Adding_a_template_web.md).
* You need to make the e-mail template available to the requisite user groups. See [User group filtering](User_groups.md).
