# Privacy - Legal basis

You need to document the legal basis for each purpose registered on a contact. In this list you add and maintain the list of legal bases that are used when editing the privacy settings for your contacts.

Example: A person sends you a request via web form and clicks a "Subscribe to newsletter" option (or similar). This means that this person has given their consent to receive e-marketing from your company. So the legal basis will be **Consent** for the purpose E-marketing.
