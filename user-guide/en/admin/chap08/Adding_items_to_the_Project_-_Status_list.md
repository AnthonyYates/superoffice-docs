# Add items to the Project - Status list

To complete the fields in the **Edit list item** dialog when you are adding an item to the **Project - Status** list:

1. Enter the name of the item in the **Name** field. This will be displayed in the option list for the **Status** field in the **Project** screen in SuperOffice CRM.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This is a mandatory field and must therefore be filled in.

2. Optionally, type in a description of the item in the **Description** field.

3. Click **Save** to save the changes in Settings and maintenance, or **Cancel** to reject your changes.

> [!NOTE]
> If you delete a status that is linked to a project guide (via a project type), this may have consequences for using the project guide.
