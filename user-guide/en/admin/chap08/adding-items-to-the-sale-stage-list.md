# Add items to the Sale - Stage list

When you add an item to the **Sale - Stage** list, the **Edit list item** dialog is not the same as described under [Add items](Adding-items.md).

To complete the fields in the **Edit list item** dialog when the list items are sale stages:

1. Enter the required name of the item in the **Name** field. This will be displayed in the option list for the **Stage** field in the **Sale** screen in SuperOffice CRM.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This is a mandatory field and must therefore be filled in.

2. Specify the probability for the item by typing a percentage in the **Probability** field. This figure will be displayed next to the stage in the **Sale** screen in SuperOffice CRM, and indicates the chance of a successful sale at this stage.

3. Optionally, type in a description of the item in the **Description** field.

4. Click **Save** to save the changes in Settings and maintenance, or **Cancel** to reject your changes.

> [!NOTE]
> If you delete a stage that is linked to a sales guide (via a sale type), this may have consequences for using the sales guide.
