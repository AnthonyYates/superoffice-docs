# Associates

> [!NOTE]
> "Associates" are SuperOffice users in your company (or a related company such as a subsidiary).

In the **Associates** tab in the **Users** screen, you can add users of the type **Associate**, and assign them roles, groups and licences, edit existing users and [delete](Deleting-users.md) users as described below.

> [!NOTE]
> In the **Users** screen you specify which licences you want different users to have. If you want to add new system licences or increase/reduce the number of licences for one or more modules, you need to contact SuperOffice to update the licence information.

## The associate list

By default, the list in the **Associates** tab consists of the following columns:

* **User ID**: The user name assigned to the associate.
* **First name**: The user’s first name.
* **Last name**: The user’s last name.
* **Primary group**: The primary group of the user.
* **Role**: The role assigned to the user. The role determines the user's access rights to data in SuperOffice CRM. See [Role](../Rolle/Role.md).
* **User plan**: The user plan assigned to the user,
* **Owning company**: The name of the organisation the user belongs to (defined as database owner).

> [!TIP]
> You can select which columns to display in the list. Just right-click a column heading, and select the relevant columns in the columns list. To change the order of the columns, click and drag a column heading.

### Filter the list

If the list of associates contains many users, you can filter and group the list to make it more manageable.

See [Filter and group users](users-associates-filter-group.md).

## User information

On the right-hand side of the window, there is detailed information about the user selected in the list of associates.

The full name, e-mail address and owning company is displayed at the top. At the bottom of this section, you can activate/deactivate the user in SuperOffice using the **Can log in** button. Click the **Task** button to access functions such as **Move user** and for sending welcome e-mails and e-mails for resetting passwords.

* In the **Detail** tab you can edit user information such as user name, role, user plan and groups. See [Add users](Adding-users-web.md)
* In the **Licences** tab, you can select licences in addition to those defined by the selected user plan.
