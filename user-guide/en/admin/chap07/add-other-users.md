# Add other users

Anonymous users and system users require the **SuperOffice Expander Services** system licence. See [Licences](../chap03/Licences_screen.md).

To add anonymous users or system users:

1. Click the **Users** button in the Navigator (![icon](../media/Knapp_Brukere_liten.bmp)).
2. Select the **Other users** tab. The list displays existing anonymous users and system users.
3. Click **Add** below the list.
4. Enter an ID in the **User ID** field.
5. Enter, if required, a password for the user in the **Password** field.
6. Enter a description of the user, as appropriate, in the **Description** text box.
7. Select one of the following options for **Type**:
    * **System user**: System users can log in to the system via third-party applications and have all rights.
    * **Anonymous**: Anonymous users have rights based on the role for anonymous users (see [Edit rights for anonymous users](../Rolle/Edit_rights_for_anonymous_users.md)). It is not usually necessary to have more than one anonymous user set up.
8. Select **Active** to the right of **Login** to activate the user.
9. Click **Save** when you have finished. The user is added to the list.
