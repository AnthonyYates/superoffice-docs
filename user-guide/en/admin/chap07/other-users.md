# Other users ![icon](../OnPremises.png)

Anonymous users and system users require the **SuperOffice Expander Services** system licence. See [Licences](../chap03/Licences-screen.md).

On the **Other users** tab in the **Users** screen, you can edit login rights for and add the following user types:

* **Anonymous**: Anonymous users have rights based on the role for anonymous users (see [Edit rights for anonymous users](../Rolle/Edit-rights-for-anonymous-users.md)). It is not usually necessary to have more than one anonymous user set up.

<!-- -->

* **System**: System users can log in to the system via third-party applications and have all rights.
