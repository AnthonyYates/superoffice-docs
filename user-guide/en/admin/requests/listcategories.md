# Categories

All requests belong to a category, and each category has its own rules that define how requests are processed in the system. Typically, the higher-level categories will correspond to the organisation's departments, while subcategories will correspond to areas of responsibility and/or logical structures within a department. Subcategories could also be the products that the company sells. An example might be to have the main categories of User Support, Development, Sales and Invoicing - and subcategories in these for each of the products that are sold.

**Disambiguation:** The term "category" is also used for company categories. See [Lists](../lists/Lists-web.md).

Users can be added as members in the categories individually or via the user group(s) they belong to (see [User groups](../users/User-groups.md)).

Selecting **Requests** in the navigator and then the **Categories** tab, takes you to a list of all the categories defined in the system. The categories are arranged in a tree structure.
