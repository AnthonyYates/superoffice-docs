# Outbox for e-mail

In the **Outbox for e-mail** tab is a list of the e-mails in the queue to be sent out.

Select **Show sent e-mails** in the lower right corner to display also the last request e-mails.

The following options are also available from the **Actions** button (![icon](../media/btn-Menu.png)):

* **Export**: Click here to export the list to a file. You can choose from these formats: Excel, HTML and plain text.

* **Send**: Click here to resend the selected e-mails. This is only necessary if there was a fault with the automatic mailing.

* **Delete**: Click here to delete the selected e-mails.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You cannot undo this operation.

If you click one of the messages in this tab, the **Outbound e-mail** screen appears. This contains information about the selected message, such as its size and who created it. Any error messages are also shown.
