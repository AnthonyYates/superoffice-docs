# Create SMS mailbox

SuperOffice can import SMS messages. For this to work, you must set up an SMS mailbox:

1. Click the **Requests** button in the navigator and select the **E-mail** tab.

2. Select the **Mailboxes** tab.

3. Click **New SMS mailbox**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If an SMS mailbox already exists, the **New SMS mailbox** button is not visible.

4. In the **Category** list box, select the default category to apply to requests created from SMS messages.

5. In the **Priority** list box, select which priority to assign to requests received via SMS.

6. In the **Customer language** list box, specify which language is to be used for the customers who send messages to this mailbox. For more details about this, see [Customer languages](../chap06/admin.listCustLangs.md).

7. Click **OK**. The SMS mailbox is created.
