# Project guide

In the **Project guide** tab in the **Workflow** screen in Settings and maintenance, you can design project guides that act as guidelines throughout the projects. A project guide consists of statuses containing follow-ups and documents to guide you through the entire project. Each project guide is linked to a project type, and the project guide is enabled in the **Project** screen in SuperOffice CRM when the user creates a new project or changes the project type of an existing project, and selects a project type that has a project guide linked to it.

**For example:** The "Conference" project type might consist of three statuses: "Planned", "In progress" and "Closing". The "Planned" status might, for example, include the "Planning meeting" follow-up (an appointment) and the "Conference programme" document (a note). For more details, see [Create a new project guide](Create_new_project_guide.md).
