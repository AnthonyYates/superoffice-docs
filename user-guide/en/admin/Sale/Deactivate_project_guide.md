# Deactivate project guide

To remove a project guide from a project type, you can deactivate the project guide. You do this by unchecking **This project type is linked to a guide** for the project type in question (see [Add items to the Project - Type, status list](../chap08/Adding_items_to_the_Project_-_Type_list.md)).

If you subsequently want to reuse the project guide, you simply check this option again. Any follow-ups and documents previously added to the project guide's statuses will be automatically retrieved. You can also add new follow-ups and/or documents, or delete those you don't want to use in this project guide.
