# Delete stopwords

The object of deleting stopwords is to include them in freetext searches after having excluded them. To delete a stopword from the list:

1. Click the **Options** button in the Navigator (![icon](../media/Knapp_Systemvalg_liten.bmp)).

2. Select the **Free text search** tab.

3. Check that freetext search is enabled for SuperOffice CRM (see [Enable freetext search](Enabling_freetext_search.md)).

4. Select the required stopword.

5. Click the **Delete** button below the stopword list.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Changes to the stopword list do not have a retroactive effect, i.e. deleted stopwords will still function as stopwords for fields that were created before you deleted them. If you want your changes to apply retroactively, you can generate a new freetext index.
