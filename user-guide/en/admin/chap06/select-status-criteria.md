# Specify status criteria

Status monitors require the use of **Sales Premium** plan or, if you are using an earlier version of SuperOffice installed on your premises, a separate license (**Sales Intelligence**). See [Licences](../chap03/Licences-screen.md).

A status is only active for companies, contacts or projects that fulfil all the criteria you have specified for the status. You need to specify one or more criteria for each status you create.

<a href="javascript:BSSCPopup(&#39;Example-status-monitors.md&#39;,800,500);" id="a10" class="BSSCPopup" onmouseover="if (parseInt(navigator.appVersion) &gt;= 4 &amp;&amp; typeof(BSPSPopupOnMouseOver) == &#39;function&#39;) BSPSPopupOnMouseOver(event);">Click here to see some examples of criteria</a>

To do this:

1. Open the **SAINT** screen.

2. Select the **Company**, **Project** or **Contact** tab.

3. Select the required status in the status list on the left of the screen.

4. Click **Add** in the list in the bottom-right (under the **Description** tab and **Create follow-up** tab). A new line is added to the list.

5. Click the arrow button ( ![icon](../media/pil-ned.bmp) ) next to the empty field, and select the required search criterion as described under [Use search criteria](using-search-criteria.md).

6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for each criterion you want to add.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can only add one instance of each criteria type for each status. For example, you cannot add the **Postcode** criterion twice.

7. Check that you have checked (![icon](../media/avmerkingsboks.bmp)) the criteria you want to use for this status.

8. Click ![icon](../media/Pil-hoeyre.bmp) **Regenerate selected status monitor** to update the status with the criteria you have added. When the status has been regenerated, no red cross will be shown by the status name.
