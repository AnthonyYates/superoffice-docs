# Status monitors

Status monitors require the use of **Sales Premium** plan or, if you are using an earlier version of SuperOffice installed on your premises, a separate license (**Sales Intelligence**). See [Licences](../chap03/Licences-screen.md).

Using the **Status monitors/SAINT** tab, you can create statuses for companies, contacts and projects. <!-- Fix reuse ID=a11 -->Click here to see some examples of statuses. Status monitors represent the functionality behind the Sales Intelligence (SAINT) concept. This facilitates following up companies, contacts and projects and provides more intelligent search options in SuperOffice CRM.

## Status images

Statuses can be shown as images on the cards of projects, contacts or companies that fulfil the criteria you have specified. The status image for a customer you have had no contact with for a while might, for example, be a spider's web. This then provides a visual and immediate indication of what your relations with the customer are or how a project is progressing. When the user clicks or holds the mouse pointer over a status image in SuperOffice CRM, some text is displayed, which might, for instance, indicate the actions that should be taken (you yourself enter the text when you create the status).

## Default follow-up for a status

When the user opens the status dialog in SuperOffice CRM, he or she is also invited to create a follow-up for the status in question. The follow-up type and text can be predefined. <!-- Fix reuse ID=a11 -->Click here for an example.

## Searches and selections

Statuses and counters can be used in searches and to create dynamic selections. For example, you can search for companies, contacts or projects that fulfil a status or a counter. [!include[Define counter](../includes/def-counter.md)]

## Periods

You can specify up to three different periods for counters, so that the SAINT criteria can cover shorter or longer periods. If you specify three periods of 30, 60 and 90 days respectively, you will be able to select SAINT criteria for each of these periods.
