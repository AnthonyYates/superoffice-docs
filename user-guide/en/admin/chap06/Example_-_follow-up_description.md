 Settings and maintenance

If, for example, the status applies to customers who have had no activity for 2 weeks, you can set **Type** to **Phone out** and enter the following description for the follow-up:

"We have had no contact with &lt;name&gt; for 2 weeks. &lt;cont&gt; should make a brief follow-up call (&lt;cpho&gt;) and check everything is OK."

In this example, the following template variables are used to tailor the text to the company in question:

&lt;name&gt; - the name of the company is inserted here.

&lt;cont&gt; - the name of our contact for the company is inserted.

&lt;cpho&gt; - the company's phone number.
