1. Open the **Licences** screen.

2. Select the **Status** tab.

3. Click the **Add** button below **System notifications**. The **Add event** dialog opens.

4. In the **Event type** list box, choose from the predefined options. See [System event types](System-events.md#systemeventtypes).

5. Specify the date and time when you expect the event to finish in the **Finished** fields.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Events are not terminated automatically. You need to remove them from the **System events** tab to terminate them.

6. Enter more detailed information about the event in the **Description** field.

    > [!NOTE]
