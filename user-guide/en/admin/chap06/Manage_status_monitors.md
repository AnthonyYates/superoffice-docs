# Manage status monitors

Status monitors require the use of **Sales Premium** plan or, if you are using an earlier version of SuperOffice installed on your premises, a separate license (**Sales Intelligence**). See [Licences](../chap03/Licences_screen.md).

The sections below contain information about how to enable and disable status monitors and how to regenerate statuses and <!-- Fix reuse ID=a4 --> (see also **Counter fields** in [Use search criteria](using_search_criteria.md)).

(a counter might be the number of sales in a period or the date of the last completed sale, and can be used in search criteria to search for companies, contacts or projects, for example)

## General information about updating and regenerating statuses and counters

At the bottom of the **Status monitors** tab, <!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->(text which shows the date of the most recent generation, if the selected status or counter has never been generated, or whether the selected status should be regenerated because of changes) are displayed for the regeneration of statuses or counters. You should regenerate statuses and/or counters if the indicators show that it is a long time since the last generation, or that the statuses and/or counters have never been generated. The same applies if statuses are amended. <!-- Fix reuse ID=a5 -->(shown as ![icon](../media/Status_inaktiv.bmp) (statuses) and ![icon](../media/Saint_Counter_Company_dis.bmp) / ![icon](../media/Saint_Counter_Project_dis.bmp) / ![icon](../media/Saint_Counter_Sale_disabled.bmp) (counters) in SuperOffice CRM)), will still be enabled and utilisable in SuperOffice CRM, but the dates returned will not necessarily be correct. The sections below described how to regenerate statuses and counters.

## Regenerate statuses

When you have added, edited or deleted a criterion (see [Select status criteria](Select_status_criteria.md)), or if, for example, you have edited an intention for a task in SuperOffice CRM, a red cross ( ![icon](../media/Roedt_kryss.bmp) ) is displayed in the status list to the left of the status(es) in question. Statuses marked with a red cross are not enabled. You must then regenerate these statuses by clicking one of these buttons:

![icon](../media/Pil_hoeyre.bmp) **Regenerate selected status monitor** (bottom of the **Company**, **Contact** or **Project** tab): Click here to regenerate the selected status.

![icon](../media/Pil_hoeyre.bmp) **Regenerate all status monitors** (bottom of the **Status** tab): Click here to regenerate all statuses.

## Regenerate counter values

![icon](../media/Pil_hoeyre.bmp) **Regenerate all counters**: Click here to regenerate all counters.
