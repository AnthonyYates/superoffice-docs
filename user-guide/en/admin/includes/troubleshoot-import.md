Rows without icons are not imported. If you see that many contacts are not being imported, this may be because they are not linked to a company. In that case, you can do one of the following:

* If the contact is actually linked to a company, you need to return to the import source (Gmail, Outlook or Excel) and specify a company for the contact. Then start the import afresh.

* If the contact is not linked to a company, but should be registered under his or her own name in SuperOffice, you need to set up the person as a company, as follows:

    1. Click **Previous** and **Configure import settings**.
    2. Click the **If no company name** list under **Contact**.
    3. Select **Create company using contact name**.
    4. Click **Save**.
    5. Click **Next**, and check that the [New company icon][img1] icon is displayed next to the contact. The person will be registered as a company in SuperOffice CRM with himself or herself as the only contact.
