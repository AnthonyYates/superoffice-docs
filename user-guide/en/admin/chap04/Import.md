# Import

![icon](../media/utropstegn.bmp) We recommend that you contact SuperOffice Support in order to back up the SuperOffice database before you import large amounts of data.

The **Import** screen is where you incorporate important external data into the SuperOffice database from. For example, you could import a customer index so you can use it in SuperOffice CRM. More specifically, in the standard version of Windows Client settings, you can import the following data into the SuperOffice database:

* Companies with associated user-defined fields and interests
* Contacts with associated user-defined fields and interests
* Projects with associated user-defined fields
* Follow-ups
* Sales
* Products
* Currencies
* Post codes / ZIP codes
* Red-letter days

You can also import companies/contacts and products in Settings and maintenance. See [Import](../import-web/Import-web.md).

The fields in the **Import** screen and their use are described under [Import files](Importing-files.md). Before you start importing, you should also read [Import routines](Import-routines.md).
