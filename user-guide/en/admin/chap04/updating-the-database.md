# Update information in the database

At some point you may need to update the database. Some organisations choose to run an update of an index of customers, for example, once a month or on demand.

You can use the import function in Windows Client settings to run new updates, for example, if you want to enter a field with new information for all the companies you have in the database. For more information, see [Import files](Importing-files.md).
