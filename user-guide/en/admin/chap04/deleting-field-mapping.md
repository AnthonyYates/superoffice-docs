# Delete field mapping

To delete a field mapping:

1. Open the **Import** screen.

    [!include[How to open import](../includes/open-import.md)]

2. Click ![icon](../../../media/icons/admin/Soek.bmp) next to the **Import description file** field and select an import description file in the dialog which opens.

3. The import description file contains information about which data file is to be imported, and this file is then shown automatically in the **Import file** field. If no file is shown here, you can click the ![icon](../../../media/icons/admin/Soek.bmp) button next to the field and navigate to the required import file.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The import description and import file must match. You cannot insert any file at will into the **Import file** field.

4. The contents of the first record in the data file you are importing are displayed in the **Field in file** column under **Field mapping**, while the **Field in SuperOffice CRM** column shows which fields in the SuperOffice database this information will be imported into. Select the row you want to delete the field mapping for.

5. Click the **Clear** button. The contents of the **Field in SuperOffice CRM** column in the selected row will be cleared.

> [!TIP]
> You can also double-click a field to delete its field mapping. If you do that, a message box asks you to confirm the deletion.
