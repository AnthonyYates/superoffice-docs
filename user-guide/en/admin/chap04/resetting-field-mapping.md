# Reset field mapping

To delete all defined field mapping:

1. Open the **Import** screen.  

    [!include[How to open import](../includes/open-import.md)]

2. Click ![icon](../media/Soek.bmp) next to the **Import description file** field and browse to an import description file in the dialog which opens.

3. The import description file contains information about which data file is to be imported, and this file is then shown automatically in the **Import file** field. If no file is shown here, you can click the ![icon](../media/Soek.bmp) button next to the field and navigate to the required import file.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The import description and import file must match. You cannot insert any file at will into the **Import file** field.

4. Click the **Clear all** button below **Field mapping**. All of the contents of the **Field in SuperOffice CRM** column will be cleared.
