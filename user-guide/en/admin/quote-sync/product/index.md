# SuperOffice products

In the **SuperOffice products** tab in the **Quote/Sync** screen, you can add price lists and products. They will be saved in the SuperOffice database, NOT in any ERP system connected to SuperOffice.

In the **Price list** list, select the required price list. The products in the price list are shown at the bottom of the view.

You can adjust this view as described in [Adjust views][6].

In the view, you have these options:

* Double-click a product to edit it. See [Add products to a price list][1].

* Click the checkbox in the column at the far left to activate/deactivate a product. See [Delete/deactivate price lists or products][3].

* Click **Add** to add a product to the price list. See [Add products to a price list][1].

* Click **Remove** to delete a product. However, we recommend that you deactivate products rather than deleting them. See [Delete/deactivate price lists or products][3].

* Click **Export** to export the list to a spreadsheet. See **Export a price list** below.

## Export a price list

You can export an open price list by clicking ![icon][img1] **Export** at the bottom of the **SuperOffice products** tab. If you only want to export some products, you can select them in the price list. If you do not select any products, all the products in the price list are exported.

<details><summary>Export not visible?</summary>

Either you do not have access rights to the export function (see [Roles][4]), or this preference is not enabled (see [Preferences][5]).
</details>

> [!TIP]
> Before you export the price list, it may be useful to select which columns you want and their order. See [Edit column view][7].
