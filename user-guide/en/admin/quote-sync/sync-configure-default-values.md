# Configure default values for synchronisation

By defining default values for fields that typically only have one relevant value, you save users a lot of time. You save them having to check a box that should always be checked or to enter a number into a field that should always contain "30". This is particularly useful when having to enter large quantities of data.

To do this:

1. Go to the **Sync** tab in the **Quote/Sync** screen. The **ERP connections** list shows existing ERP connections.
2. Uncheck the box in the **Active** column for the ERP connection you want to edit.
3. Select the ERP connection, and click the **Defaults** button at the bottom. The **Configure Sync Default Values** dialog displays the tabs for the available actors in the ERP system.
4. Select the tab for the actor you want to configure default values for.
5. Click **Add** at the bottom of the dialog. The **Add sync default value** dialog appears.
6. **ERP Field**: here you select which field in the ERP system you want to define a default value for.
7. **Set default value**: Check here to set a default value for the ERP field you selected above. Once you have checked here, you set the default value underneath.
8. **Ask user for value**: check here to allow the user to enter a value.
9. **Mandatory - User must fill in value**: check here to require the user to enter a value in the field. If the selected ERP field is mandatory, this field will be checked by default.
10. Click **OK** when you have finished.
11. Repeat steps 5-10 to add more default values.
