# Roles

Using role-based security in SuperOffice CRM, you can customise roles for different access levels in the company.

A role describes two things:

* Which <!-- Fix reuse ID=a2 -->(companies, contacts, projects, project members, selections, sales, follow-ups, documents, relations, stakeholders and dashboards) are to be made <!-- Fix reuse ID=a3 -->(accessibility is specified using rights: none, read, create, update and delete) for the users who have this role.
* Which <!-- Fix reuse ID=a4 -->(e.g. administrator access in Settings and maintenance, allow bulk update, quote approval, mail merge, exporting selections and publishing)  are to be made accessible to users with this role.

A number of predefined roles are included with SuperOffice CRM. The **User levels 0â€“5** roles correspond to the user levels from previous versions of SuperOffice, where user level 0 is an administrator. You can edit these roles at will.

<!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->
