# Edit rights for anonymous users ![icon](../OnPremises.png)

Some functions in this topic require a separate licence (anonymous users). See [Licences](../chap03/Licences-screen.md).

There is only one role for anonymous users and only the data rights for this role can be edited.

To do this:

1. Click the **Roles** button in the Navigator (![icon](../media/Knapp-rolle-liten.bmp)).
2. Select the **Anonymous** tab.
3. Enter the data rights in the **Data rights** tab as described under [Set data rights for a role](Set-data-rights-for-role.md).  
    ![icon](../media/question.bmp) <!-- Fix reuse ID=a2 -->
    You can choose from these rights:

    | Name | Rights | Tooltips |
    |---|---|---|
    | None | No rights | |
    | Read | Read rights | R |
    | Create | Read and create rights | CR |
    | Update | Read, create and update rights | CRU |
    | Delete | Read, create, update and delete rights | CRUD |

    **C** = Create, **R** = Read, **U** = Update, **D** = Delete

The changes are saved automatically.
