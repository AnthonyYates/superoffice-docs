# Edit standard templates

You can edit the standard templates supplied with SuperOffice CRM and save them with your own names. Using the standard templates as a basis, you can, for example, change the font and font size, insert graphics and replace or add fields.

> [!NOTE]
> You must not change the file names of the system templates as this will prevent the functions included in them from working.

To change a standard template:

1. Click the **Lists** button in the Navigator (![icon](../media/Knapp-Lister-liten.bmp)).
2. Click the arrow (![icon](../media/pil-ned.bmp)) and select **Document - Template**.  
    All previously defined items for the selected list are displayed in the **Items** list.
3. Double-click the required item in the **Items** list. The **Edit list item** dialog opens.
4. Click the **Edit** button. The document opens in the correct application.
5. Save the document with a new name to keep the original template intact, or with the same name to overwrite it.

> [!NOTE]
> If you save a standard template with a new name, you have created a new template. You must link this template to SuperOffice CRM. For more details, see [Add a document template](Adding-template-web.md).
