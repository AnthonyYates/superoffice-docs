# Add headings

Before linking a heading to an item, you need to add the headings you require:

1. Open the **Lists** screen.

2. [!include[Click arrow and select](../../includes/expand-list.md)] the required list.

3. Check **Use grouping and filtering by user group for this list** (top right).

4. Go to the **Headings** tab.

5. Click the **Add** button below the **Headings** list to add a new heading. The **Edit heading** dialog opens.

6. Enter the required name for the heading in the **Name** field.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This is a mandatory field and must therefore be filled in.

7. Type in a description of the heading, if required, in the **Description** field.

8. Click **Save** to save the changes in Settings and maintenance, or **Cancel** to reject your changes.

The item is added to the **Headings** list. Repeat this procedure to add more headings.

When you have added the required headings, choose which headings each item will be displayed under. This is described under [Group items under headings][1].
