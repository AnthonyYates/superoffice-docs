# Add items to the General - Currency list

When you add an item to the **General - Currency** list, the **Edit list item** dialog is not the same as described under [Add items][1].

To complete the fields in the **Edit list item** dialog when the items are currencies:

1. Enter the required name of the item in the **Name** field.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This is a mandatory field and must therefore be filled in.

2. Specify the rate for the relevant currency by entering a number in the **Rate** field.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This is the rate against the base currency. The base currency is the currency where the rate is set to 1. If the base currency is EUR, the rate for the other currencies is calculated against this currency in terms of the specified unit (see next point). This might mean for example that GBP 1 corresponds to EUR 1.562 at the dayâ€™s rate, while NOK 100 would correspond to EUR 12.677. This calculation will be displayed after you have specified the exchange rate and unit.

3. Specify the unit to be used in relation to the basic currency in the **Unit** field. The default here might be for example 100 for Norwegian kroner and 1 for British pounds.

4. Optionally, type in a description of the currency in the **Description** field.

5. Click **Save**. The currency is added as a separate item in the **Items** list. Repeat this procedure to add more currencies.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You must enable currencies and set the default currency in the **Preferences** screen (in the **System** group).
