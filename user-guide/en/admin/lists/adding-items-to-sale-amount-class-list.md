# Add items to the Sale - Amount class list

[!include[Requirement](../includes/note-saint-req-2.md)]

When you add an item to the **Sale - Amount class** list, the **Edit List Item** dialog is not the same as described under [Add items][1].

[!include[Edit list item](../../includes/edit-list-item.md)] when the list items are amount classes:

1. Enter the required name of the item in the **Name** field.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This is a mandatory field and must therefore be filled in.

2. In the **Amount from** and **Amount to** fields, you can specify the range that will put the sale in this category. The amount must be entered in the currency your organisation uses.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The range of amounts may not overlap ranges in existing amount classes.

3. In the **Currency** list, select the currency your organization uses. You can add multiple amount classes with other currencies if your organization requires this.

4. Optionally, type in a description of the amount class in the **Description** field.

5. Click **Save** to save the changes in Settings and maintenance, or **Cancel** to reject your changes.
