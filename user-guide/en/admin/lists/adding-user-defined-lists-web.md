# Add user-defined lists

To add a new list in the **Lists** screen:

1. Click the **Lists** button in the Navigator (![icon](../../../media/icons/admin/Knapp-Lister-liten.bmp)).

2. Click the **Create list** button in the top right of the screen.

3. Enter the required name of the list in the **Name** field.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This is a mandatory field and must therefore be filled in.

4. Optionally, type in a description of the list in the **Description** field.

5. Click **OK** to save the list in Settings and maintenance.

The list is added to the **Lists** list. If you check the list in the list, the description will be displayed at the top of the **Lists** screen.

As well as specifying a name and description for the list, you need to add items to it. This described under [Add items](Adding-items.md).
