# Headings

<!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->

If a list is very long (i.e. it contains a large number of items), you can use headings to group the items logically. The items in the **Document templates** list, for example, are grouped in the **Letter**, **Fax**, **E-mail** headings and so on.

List items can be displayed at two levels. The higher level is called the itemâ€™s *heading*. A heading contains item groups that can be displayed under the selected item in SuperOffice CRM.

The **Headings** list (in the bottom right of the **Lists** screen) shows which headings the individual items are displayed under. You can also go to the **Headings** tab to see which items appear under a specific heading.

> [!TIP]
> The same items can appear under several headings.
