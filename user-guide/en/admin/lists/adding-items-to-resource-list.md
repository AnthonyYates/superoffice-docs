# Add items to the General - Resource list

When you add an item to the **General - Resource** list, the **Edit List Item** dialog is not the same as described under [Add items].

[!include[Edit list item](../../includes/edit-list-item.md)] when the list items are resources:

1. Enter the required name of the item in the **Name** field.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This is a mandatory field and must therefore be filled in.

2. In the **Type** field, you specify whether the resource type:
    * **Location**: Resources of this type (for example meeting rooms) will be available in the **Location** list in the follow-up dialogsin SuperOffice CRM, in addition to the **Resource** list in the **Invitation** dialog.
    * **Other**: Resources of this type (for example a projector, loudspeaker, or other equipment) will be available in the **Resource** list in the **Invitation** dialog.

3. If you select **Location** as the resource type, you can enter an address in the **Address** field.

4. Optionally, type in a description of the resource in the **Description** field.

5. Click **Save** to save the changes in Settings and maintenance, or **Cancel** to reject your changes.
