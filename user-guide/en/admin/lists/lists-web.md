# Lists

The **Lists** screen contains descriptions and definitions of the lists in SuperOffice CRM. Here you can customise the predefined lists supplied with SuperOffice CRM.

> [!TIP]
> To quickly go to a list, click **Lists** in the navigator and start typing in the search field ( ![icon](../../../media/icons/admin/Soek.bmp) ). The search results are updated while you type.

You can also add your own user-defined lists which are displayed on the **More** tabs in SuperOffice CRM. You specify what is displayed in the **More** tabs in the **Fields** screen (see [Fields](../fields-web/Fields-web.md)).

The **Lists** screen is divided into the following parts:

> [!NOTE]
> User groups and headings are not displayed for lists where they are irrelevant.

* At the top of the screen, you can click the list box to choose from among all available lists in SuperOffice, both predefined and user-defined lists. See [Add user-defined lists](Adding-user-defined-lists-web.md).
* The **Items** tab contains the items that are available for the selected list. See [Items](Items.md).
* The **User groups** tab shows items per user group. See [User group filtering](User-groups.md).
* The **Headings** tab shows items per heading. See [Headings](Headings-web.md).
* In the **Visible for user groups** list, you can see to which group(s) the item selected in the **Items** list will be displayed. You can for example choose to have different follow-up types available for your Sales, Support and Accounting user groups. See [User group filtering](User-groups.md).
* The **Headings** list shows the headings under which the individual items are displayed. If a list is very long (i.e. it contains a large number of items), you can use headings to group the items logically. The items in the **Document - Template** list, for example, are grouped in the **Letter**, **Fax**, **E-mail** headings and so on. See [Headings](Headings-web.md).

At the top right side is the **Use grouping and user group filtering for this list** checkbox, where you specify whether the list can be grouped and filtered. This option is deactivated for lists where this is irrelevant. See [Organizing lists](Grouping-and-filtering.md).

At the bottom of the **Lists** screen is the **Show deleted items and headings** checkbox, which allows you to undo the deletion of items and headings. See [Delete items](Deleting-items.md) and [Deleted items and headings](Deleted-items-and-headings.md).
