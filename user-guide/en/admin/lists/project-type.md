# Project - Type, status

The **Project** tab in the **Project** screen in SuperOffice CRM contains the **Type** field. This field has a predefined list of options which are set up in the **Lists** screen in Settings and maintenance.

Each project in SuperOffice CRM must have a project type, and each project type can contain several statuses (see [Project - Status](Project-Status.md)). You can also specify that specific project types are to have a [project guide](../Sale/Project.md), to guide you through the different statuses of a project, with associated follow-ups and documents.
