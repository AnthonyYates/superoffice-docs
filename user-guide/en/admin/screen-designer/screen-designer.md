# ![icon](../media/Knapp-ScreenDesigner.png) Screen designer

Screen designer (configurable screens) requires the Developer Tools licence.

Your sales team, support team and management team do not necessarily have the same focus and requirements concerning the data they need to access most frequently in SuperOffice. The solution is to create custom screens for each team. Your organization will save time by allowing your teams to find relevant information more quickly. Configure the layout of your main screens and define which types of information each team (user group) can access and see on the company and contact cards.

* Move the most important fields to the first tab.
* Use columns, labels/titles and dividers to organize information into logical groups.
* Format fields to emphasize key data (e.g. bold and large font) for better visibility.
* Move less important fields to secondary tabs.
* Remove fields that are never used.
* Add links/buttons for looking up information in other websites or to manually trigger an automated process based on CRM Script.

> [!NOTE]
> When this feature is activated, the fields in your current **More** tab for the **Company** and **Contact** screens will change to form two columns. You can edit these tabs in the screen designer (see [Edit layout](ScreenDesigner-Edit-layout.md)).

Currently you can create customer screen layouts for the company and contact cards, as seen at the top of the screen. The **Layouts** list displays any existing screen layouts (usually the default layout), with a preview screen on the right.

The layouts are marked with status (published or draft) and the assigned user groups.
