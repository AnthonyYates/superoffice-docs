# Add new layout

With custom screen layouts for each of your teams, finding customer data will be easier than ever. The most relevant data will always be available and visible. Remove, move or hide irrelevant or less important data to unclutter the company and contact cards. The result will be a cleaner and more tidy screen for your teams to work in.

To create a new screen layout:

1. Click the **Screen designer** button in the Navigator (![icon](../media/Knapp_ScreenDesigner_small.png)).

2. Click **Company** or **Contact** at the top.

3. Click **Add** under **Layouts**. The **Add new layout** dialog opens.

4. Select a layout in the **Create new based on** list. The new layout will be based on the selected layout.

5. Enter a name for the new layout in the **Name** field.

6. Click the **Used by** field and select the user group(s) that will use this new layout. The list will only display user groups that are using the default layout. A user group can only be assigned to one layout.

7. Enter a description of the layout in the **Description** field.

8. Click **OK** when you are done. The new layout is added to the **Layouts** list. It has the status **Draft**, meaning it is not yet visible to any users. The preview is displayed on the right side of the screen.

    **Tip**: If you later want to edit the layout settings, double-click the layout in the list to open the **Edit layout settings** dialog. Please note that you cannot edit the settings for the default layout.

9. With the new layout selected in the **Layouts** list, click the **Edit layout button** to customize the screen layout. See [Edit layout](ScreenDesigner_Edit_layout.md).

**Note**: To delete a layout, select the layout in the **Layouts** list and click **Delete**. User groups that have been assigned to the deleted layout, will go back to the default layout.
