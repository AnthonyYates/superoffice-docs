# Edit preference settings

To change an existing setting:

1. Click the **Preferences** button in the Navigator ( ![icon](../media/Knapp-Preferanser-liten.bmp) ).

2. Select the required preference group in the list box at the top.

3. Select the required preference from the **Preferences** list. The settings already defined for this preference are displayed in the **Active settings** field.

    > [!TIP]
    > If this field is empty, it may be because the options to show different levels are not checked (see [Display different levels](Displaying-different-levels.md)).

4. Double-click the setting you want to change. The **Setting** dialog opens.

5. Make the required changes in the dialog. The various fields are described under [Add preference settings](Adding-preference-settings.md).

6. Click **Save** to save your changes in Settings and maintenance. The setting becomes available to users the next time they log in to SuperOffice CRM.

> [!NOTE]
> You can click **Cancel** to reject your changes.
