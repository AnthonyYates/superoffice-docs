# Preferences

In the **Preferences** tab you can specify a number of settings for different parts of SuperOffice CRM, such as the number of items to display in the history list, the default type for new appointment, task and phone call, and the default currency in the **Sale** screen.

Preferences that can only be set on a global (system) level, can be found in the <a href="Global-preferences.md" style="font-weight: bold;">Global preferences</a> tab.

> [!TIP]
> Use the **Freetext search** field at the top of the screen to find the preference you want to change. The search results will be displayed in the list below.

At the top of the **Preferences** tab, you can choose the required preference group.

The rest of the **Preferences** tab is divided into three main sections:

* On the left is the **Preferences** list containing all the preferences defined for the active preference group.

> [!NOTE]
> Preferences with active individual settings are shown in bold text in the preferences list.

* At the top right, the description field shows a description of the preference currently selected in the **Preferences** list.
* Below, the **Active settings** field shows the settings specified for the preference currently selected in the **Preferences** list. See [Active settings](Active-settings.md).
