# Document library

By default, your SuperOffice site is connected to the SuperOffice document library. All documents, templates and e-mails are stored in this library.

If your organization is using SharePoint, you can configure SuperOffice to use SharePoint as the default document library.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can start this configuration, you need to set up site permissions and library permissions in SharePoint.

See [Configure SharePoint document library](Configure-SharePoint-document-library.md)
