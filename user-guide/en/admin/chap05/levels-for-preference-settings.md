# Levels for preference settings

You can specify preference settings for four different levels:

<table style=" margin-top:5px; left:0px; top:88px; width:100%; max-width:544px;" data-cellspacing="0">

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><p>System</p></td>
<td><p>Global preferences that apply to all users in the system, including all satellites, groups and individual users.</p>
<p>> [!NOTE]
> Preferences that can only be set on a global (system) level, can be found in the <a href="Global-preferences.md" style="font-weight: bold;">Global preferences</a> tab.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Database</p></td>
<td><p>Preferences that apply to one specific database and all groups and users connected to this database.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Group</p></td>
<td><p>Preferences that apply to all users in a specific group.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>User</p></td>
<td><p>Preferences that are linked to each individual user.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

You can specify different values for different levels so that, for example, you can have one setting for a user and a different setting for the user group that the contact belongs to. The lowest level always applies.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all levels are available for all preferences. If any of the options are disabled, you cannot choose them for the selected preference.
