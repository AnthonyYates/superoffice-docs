# Active settings

The **Active settings** field contains a list of the settings for the preference currently selected in the **Preferences** list, and the levels and the values for each of them. You can edit and delete existing settings and add new ones in this field.

The field consists of three columns:

* **Who**: Shows who the setting applies to, i.e. the name of the system, database, group or user.

* > [!NOTE]
> If this is an individual user, a tooltip about this user will pop up when you hold the mouse pointer over the userâ€™s initials in this column.

* **Level**: shows which level the setting applies to: system, database, group or user (see [Levels for preference settings](Levels_for_preference_settings.md)).

* **Value**: shows the value specified for the setting.

The contents of these columns are defined in the **Setting** dialog. For more details, see [Add preference settings](Adding_preference_settings.md).

You can sort the rows in the columns by clicking on the required column heading. Click the column heading once to sort in reverse order.
