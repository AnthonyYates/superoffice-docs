# Displaying different levels

You can choose which settings will be displayed in the list, based on the level they are specified for, in the **Active settings** field. The levels displayed depend on which of the following checkboxes you have checked at the bottom of the field:

* User
* Group
* Database

> [!NOTE]
> Settings for the system level are always displayed.

You can use these checkboxes to show one, two or all levels. For more information about the different fields, see [Levels for preference settings][1].
