# View preferences in SuperOffice CRM

Users can edit the settings of individual preferences to customise them for their own use using **Preferences** in the **Personal settings** menu in the Top bar in SuperOffice CRM. The preferences available to the user in SuperOffice CRM depend on what is specified in Settings and maintenance.

To specify that a preference will be displayed in SuperOffice CRM:

1. Click the **Preferences** button in the Navigator ( ![icon][img1] ).
2. Select the required preference group in the list box at the top.
3. Select the required preference from the **Preferences** list.
4. Check **Allow individual settings**. The preference will then be displayed in the **Preferences** dialog in SuperOffice CRM, and each individual user will be able to edit the settings for his or her own use.

> [!NOTE]
> Settings at the user level are not available for all preferences.
