# Configure video meetings

> [!NOTE]
> To be able to send and receive e-mail invitations to video meetings (to/from external users), you must have configured your e-mail setup in SuperOffice CRM (user client) or use SuperOffice Mail Link. See [E-mail setup for video meetings](Setup-1-Configure-email-setup-in-SuperOffice.md).

To select and configure outgoing video meetings:

1. Click the **Preferences** button in the Navigator ( ![icon](../media/Knapp-Preferanser-liten.bmp) ).

2. Select the **Video meetings** tab.

3. Click the **Configure** button. A new browser tab opens.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If a service provider has already been selected, you need to click **Disconnect** before selecting a new one.

4. Select the service provider your company uses for video meetings. A new tab opens.

5. You will be forwarded to the service provider's authentication portal. Here you must do the following:

    * authenticate and validate your user (to find more info on how to do this for each service provider, see [Video Meetings for SuperOffice][1])
    * confirm that the service provider is allowed to connect to SuperOffice

6. When you have completed the step above, you are redirected back to the **Video meetings** screen.

7. Verify that the configuration has been set up correctly. Under **Set configurations** you should now see the name of the selected service provider and your user name.

8. Depending on the service provider you have selected, there may be additional settings to configure here. Edit the settings as necessary and click **Save**.

9. You can now close the browser tab and return to SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.

If you want to select another provider or change the configuration, click **Configure**.
