# Delete preference settings

To delete an existing setting:

1. Click the **Preferences** button in the Navigator ( ![icon][img1] ).

2. Select the required preference group in the list box at the top.

3. Select the required preference from the **Preferences** list. The settings already defined for this preference are displayed in the **Active settings** field.

    > [!TIP]
    > If this field is empty, it may be because the options to show different levels are not checked (see [Display different levels][1]).

4. Select the setting(s) you want to delete and click **Delete** at the bottom of the window. All selected settings are removed from the list straightaway.
