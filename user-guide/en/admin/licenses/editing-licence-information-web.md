# Edit licence information

If you wish to increase or reduce the number of licences for one or more modules, you need to contact SuperOffice to update the licence information. The licence will normally be updated automatically without you needing to do anything.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have problems fetching new licence information from the web, you can contact SuperOffice to get a licence file sent to you. Click the **Load licence from file** button in order to update the licences.

If the total number of new licences is less than the number of licences in use, you must reduce the number of user licences in use.

To do this:

1. Go to the **Licences** screen, and select the **SUPEROFFICE** tab. If you have installed a third-party module or similar, several tabs will be displayed here. The functionality is the same.

2. Click the **Activate new licence** link. The **Activate new licence** dialog shows the licences that have been changed. Licences shown in red or with negative numbers and a warning icon must be edited. The **Activate** button remains disabled until you have edited these licences.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you have the wrong number of licences or licences for the wrong module, you need to contact SuperOffice. DO NOT activate the licences if the number is incorrect.

3. Click a red licence name (link). The **Remove superfluous licences** dialog opens. Shown at the top of the dialog are the number of licences in use, the number of licences that are available and the number that you must remove. The list below shows all the users who are using this licence.

4. Remove licences for the specified number of users.

5. Click **OK** when you have finished.

6. Click the **Activate** button in the **Activate new licence** dialog.

7. Go to the **Licences** screen, select the **SUPEROFFICE** tab, and check that the licence status is correct.

> [!TIP]
> Go to the **Users** screen, and select the **User licences** tab to see which users are using the different licences. In the **Associates** and **Other users** tabs, you can filter the list by licence type.
