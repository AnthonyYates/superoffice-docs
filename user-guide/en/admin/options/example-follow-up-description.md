If, for example, the status applies to customers who have had no activity for 2 weeks, you can set **Type** to **Phone out** and enter the following description for the follow-up:

```text
"We have had no contact with <name> for 2 weeks. <cont> should make a brief follow-up call (<cpho>) and check everything is OK."
```

In this example, the following template variables are used to tailor the text to the company in question:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| &lt;name&gt; | the name of the company is inserted here |
| &lt;cont&gt; | the name of our contact for the company is inserted |
| &lt;cpho&gt; | the company's phone number |
