# Change labels

You can change labels in all available languages in SuperOffice.

> [!NOTE]
> These changes apply only to SuperOffice CRM and not, for example, to reports or labels in Reporter Studio.

To change labels in SuperOffice CRM:

1. Open the **Options** screen.

2. Select the **Labels** tab.

3. Check **Enable label substitution**.

4. Type in all or part of the label you want to change in the field below the language field on the left. This is the language that has been selected for your user.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you want to search for labels in another language, select the language in the list on the right and enter the search word in the field below.

5. Press **ENTER**. The list will be updated with labels containing the search text.

    > [!TIP]
    > Hold the mouse pointer over a row to display the resource ID for the label.

6. Double-click the label you want to change.

7. Edit the text for the language in question in the **Edit field label** dialog.

    > [!NOTE]
    > It is possible to edit the label for all available languages in this dialog. Not only the selected target language.

8. Click **Save**.
