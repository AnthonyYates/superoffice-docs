# Reports

From the **Reports** tab in the **Options** screen, you can edit the names and descriptions of standard reports in SuperOffice CRM. In addition, you can choose which reports will be published (meaning made available to users). You also have the option of importing new reports.

In the report list, you see the format of the reports (appearance), whether a report is a standard report or not, the report type (content), and whether it has been published. Click a report to display the report description at the bottom of the tab.

## Edit standard reports

To open and edit a standard report:

1. Go to the **Reports** tab in the **Options** screen.
2. Double-click the standard report you want to edit. The **Edit report** dialog opens.
3. Edit the name and description. You cannot edit the report type.
4. Check the **Published** checkbox to make the report available to users.
5. Click **Save** when you have finished.

You cannot delete standard reports, but you can specify them as not published.

## Importing reports

You can import reports that have been exported from SuperOffice Reporter Studio, or created by a consultant or by SuperOffice Support.
