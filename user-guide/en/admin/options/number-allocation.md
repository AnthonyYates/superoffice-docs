# Number allocation

You can define settings for counters in the **Number allocation** tab. In SuperOffice CRM, counters can apply to the following fields:

* **Number** fields in the **Company** screen, the **Project** screen, the **Sale** screen and the **Contact** dialog.

* The **Our Ref.** field in the **Document** dialog if it is defined for the relevant template.

* Counters from third party suppliers can also be used.

The way a counter works is to increase the value of the field by 1 each time a new instance of it is used. For example, if the first company you create in the database is allocated the value 10001 in the **Number** field, then the nineteenth company will be allocated the value **10019**.
