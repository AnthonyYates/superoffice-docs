# Select page 1 fields

Among the user-defined fields that are displayed in the **More** tabs in SuperOffice CRM, you can choose *three* that will function as page 1 fields (so called because they are displayed on the "first page" in their respective screens).

<!-- Fix reuse ID=a1 -->

* The **Company** tab in the **Company** screen
* The **Contact** tab on the contact card
* From the **Project** tab in the **Project** screen
* The **Sale** tab in the **Sale** screen

> [!NOTE]
> This option is not available for documents and follow-ups.

To display a user-defined field on the first page:

1. Open the **Fields** screen.
2. Click one of the **Company**, **Contact**, **Project** or **Sale** tabs.
3. Check **Allow different page 1 fields for different user groups** at the bottom of the tab if you want to specify different page 1 fields for different user groups. If this is left unchecked, the fields you specify will be used for all user groups.
4. In the user group list above, select the required user group (if you have checked **Allow different page 1 fields for different user groups** in the previous step). For more details on user groups, see [User groups and page 1 fields][1].
5. In the **Field 1** list box, choose the field to display at the top. Choose the fields to display in the next positions in the **Field 2** and **Field 3** list boxes.
6. Click **Save** to save your changes only in Settings and maintenance or click **Publish** to make the changes available to SuperOffice CRM users.
