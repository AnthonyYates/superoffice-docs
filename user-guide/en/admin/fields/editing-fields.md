# Edit fields

To edit a field from one of the **More** tabs in SuperOffice CRM:

[!include[Go to fields and select tab](includes/goto-fields.md)]

1. Double-click the required field in the **Fields** list.

1. Make the necessary changes in the various fields (under [Add fields][1] you will find an overview of what to specify here).

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Type** list box only contains the options you can change, i.e. where existing data can be converted so that it fits the new field type.

1. Click **Save**.

1. Click **Publish** if you want the changes to be available to SuperOffice CRM users.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are defining [page 1 fields][2], you must first publish the changes for user-defined fields. Then you need to define page 1 fields for the various user groups and save (not publish).
