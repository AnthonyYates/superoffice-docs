# Edit fields

To edit a field from one of the **More** tabs in SuperOffice CRM:

1. Open the **Fields** screen.

2. Go to the required tab: **Company**, **Contact**, **Project**, **Sale**, **Follow-up** or **Document**.

3. Double-click the required field in the **Fields** list.

4. Make the necessary changes in the various fields (under [Add fields][1] you will find an overview of what to specify here).

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Type** list box only contains the options you can change, i.e. where existing data can be converted so that it fits the new field type.

5. Click **Save**.

6. Click **Publish** if you want the changes to be available to SuperOffice CRM users.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are defining page 1 fields (see [Page 1 fields][2]), you must first publish the changes for user-defined fields. Then you need to define page 1 fields for the various user groups and save (not publish).
