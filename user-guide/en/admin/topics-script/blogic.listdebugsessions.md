# Debugger

The debug tool makes it easy to find and fix bugs inside your scripts and macros. You can debug your scripts and macros in a production environment, without interfering with the other SuperOffice users. It allows you to investigate your scripts and macros in real time, while they are executed. You can step through the execution of your script, use breakpoints and view the variable values.

You can debug a script or macro by opening it in the **Macros and scripts** tab and click ![icon][img1] **Debug script**.

To go to the **Macros and scripts** tab:

* In SuperOffice Service: Select ![icon][img2] **System settings** &gt; **System design** &gt; **CRMScript** and go to the **Macros and scripts** tab.
* In SuperOffice Settings and maintenance: Click **CRMScript** in the navigator and go to the **Macros and scripts** tab.

You can also click ![icon](../media/btn-script-trace-small.png) **Trace script** to start [tracing a script](Tracing.md).
