# Project - Status

The **Project** tab in the **Project** screen in SuperOffice CRM contains the **Status** field. This field has a predefined list of options which are set up in the **Lists** screen in Settings and maintenance.

The statuses displayed in the list depend of the project type. You can select which statuses should be available for the different project types in the [Project - Type, status][1] list.
